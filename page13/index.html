    <p>After lot of team shifts and last-minute scrambling for players, we scraped together a squad to send to Clambake. I only knew half the team
going into the weekend, but they turned out to be a great bunch. We also had people drop and pick up as the tourney progressed. We ended up
winning all our pool games and making it all the way to semis before Silence of the Clams knocked us out. The weekend was cold and windy on
the whole, so a lot of games were upwind-downwind turnoverfests. Our &ldquo;bobbing for shots&rdquo; game went over really well during the day. The game
didnt make it to the party because we went hard pretty early and lost focus.</p>

<p>For Time (18min Time Cap):</p>

<p>30/20/10 reps of:</p>

<p>The most difficult part was the second round. The pullups got really slow (2 at a time
sometimes) and the bike was really tiring on my arms. The last set wasn&rsquo;t as bad because I banged out the squats and pullups in one set,
then powered through on the bike to make sure I got done before the cap.</p>

    <p>First night of fall league. Met my team, which turned out to be pretty
cool. I was told it was very top-heavy, but I think all the players are at
least decent. No one&rsquo;s unathletic. We lost our first game to Bosco&rsquo;s team
by 1, then beat shockey&rsquo;s team by 1. Everyone played well, though some of
the newer players need some coaching. I got a decent number of Ds (mostly
poach Ds) and threw some nice goals (mostly to Kamil). Indoor is a great
workout.</p>

    <p>3 days of ultimate with Metro North. Played 7 games total. Didn&rsquo;t play that great overall, but improved throughout the weekend. Best game was the last game against Wildcard.</p>

<p>In general, my main places to improve are fitness (as always), throwing, and switching my mindset from D to O. My biggest issue was too many bad throwing decisions after getting a turn. I play much better when I look for breaks and move the disc quickly, not try to huck it. I don&rsquo;t think I completed any hucks at all this weekend.</p>

<p>Btw, we finished 7th at nationals and qualified for the Pro Flight for next year.</p>

    <p>My first Northeast regionals experience. Pool play on Saturday was fairly
easy. I think we beat every team by at least 6-7 points. Winning our pool
put us up against Slow White in semis. That was one of the best games we&rsquo;ve
played all year. I didn&rsquo;t play much (only a few points), but the team
played well as a whole and we won on universe point. Since there are 4 bids
this year, winning against Slow (only the 2nd time I&rsquo;ve ever beaten them)
made sure that we qualified for nationals, since we couldn&rsquo;t do worse than
3rd at that point.</p>

<p>On Sunday, we played Wildcard in the finals. The game was decent but they
played very strong D, went up 8-6 in the first half, then scored a few more
breaks in the second to seal the win. Then we played Slow White again in
the 2-3 placement game. Once again a solid game. This time they came out on
top. Our defense converted 2 breaks (same as Saturday) but O gave up a few
more that we couldn&rsquo;t make up for.</p>

<p>T minus 18 days until Nationals.</p>

    <p>Signed up last-minute for a hat tournament in Enfield (just north of Hartford). Ended up on Barb and Timmer&rsquo;s team. We started off weak, getting crushed in our first game. But then we dug in and won the next two pool games and three straight semis games to win the tourney. The final was us vs. the team we lost to first game. We were really tired (the day was HOT) and had lost some players to injury and concerts, so we picked up a few replacements. They also lost their best player, but picked up quality replacements as well. Victory was sweet, esp because we got a round of free wings for winning. I also met a bunch of cool CT ultimate players.</p>

    <h2>Strength/Skill Work</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Eccentric Handstand Pushups, focussing on form</li>
<li>8 DB Skull Crushers</li>
</ul>


<p>My handstand form was pretty weak. I tended to arch my back too much. Most of the reps, I focussed on bringing my ribs in, keeping my body tight, and my hands close to the wall. The coach gave me a good cue to focus on form: lie down facedown on the mat with your arms overhead against the bottom of a wall. That&rsquo;s the form for a handstand. Focus on what that feels like and keep that form.</p>

<p>For skull crushers, I used <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">12.5</span># </span> dumbbells, but should go up next time.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>Two 6min AMRAP WODs with a twist. Each WOD starts with a buy-in, which you have to do before you start counting rounds.</p>

<p>Rest 3 min between WODs</p>

<h3>First WOD</h3>

<p>Buy-in: 100m Bear Crawl. Then, with the time remaining:</p>

<ul>
<li>100m Run</li>
<li>10 Box Jumps (24in)</li>
</ul>


<p>Did 3 rounds, the run, and 7 box jumps in the 4th round. So close&hellip;</p>

<h3>Second WOD</h3>

<p>Buy-in: 400m Run. Then,</p>

<ul>
<li>20 Total Walking Lunge Steps</li>
<li>10/arm DB Snatch</li>
</ul>


<p>Got through 2 rounds plus 10 snatches with one arm.</p>

    <p>Got home from Crossfit just in time to see that a critical mass had gathered for mini. Ended up going despite feeling tired, and was pretty happy that I went. Special guest Tree joined us for the games. We played for a while, then finished with a 3-team round-robin.</p>

    <h2>Strength/Skill Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Back Squat 3x5 @ 75% 1RM</li>
<li>Ab Rollouts 3x10</li>
</ul>


<p>Used 170lb for the squats and 25lb plates on a bar for the rollout. Rollouts were harder than what I&rsquo;m used to with the ab wheel.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time:</p>

<ul>
<li>20 Back Squats (from floor)</li>
<li>40 Tuck Ups</li>
<li>400m Run</li>
<li>15 Back Squats</li>
<li>30 Tuck Ups</li>
<li>300m Run</li>
<li>10 Back Squats</li>
<li>20 Tuck Ups</li>
<li>200m Run</li>
</ul>


<p>Did it in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">12</span>:<span class="number">29</span> </span> with 115lb on the bar. Cleaning/pressing the bar off the floor before each set was an interesting new twist.</p>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>6 Shoulder Press, building up to 70% 1RM</li>
<li>Ring Push Ups</li>

<p>65lb press, 5 pushups per round</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>15:00 AMRAP</p>

<ul>
<li>10 Push Press (from floor)</li>
<li>10 Box Jumps (24in box)</li>
<li>10 Push Ups</li>
<li>Run: 50m * # of rounds (so 50m first round, 100m second round, etc)</li>
</ul>


<p>Got through exactly 5 rounds, using 75lb for the push press. I picked up the bar for the 6th round, but didn&rsquo;t get any reps in.</p>

    <h2>Strength/Skill Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>5x5 Overhead Squat, building up to heavy weight</li>
<li>60 seconds Double Unders practice</li>
</ul>


<p>I suck at OHS. Only got up to 55lb on that. But I did manage to do 4 double
unders in a row on two separate occasions.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>The WOD was a progression of overhead squats and double-unders, but I
subbed in 2 x singles because I can&rsquo;t do doubles yet.</p>

<p>For time:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 OHS, 100 singles</li>
<li>8 OHS, 80 singles</li>
<li>6 OHS, 60 singles</li>
<li>4 OHS, 40 singles</li>
<li>2 OHS, 100 singles</li>
</ul>


<p>I used just the bar (so <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">45</span>lb </span>) for the squats. Finished the whole
thing in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span>:<span class="number">30</span> </span>. The cutoff was 8 minutes for the whole thing, and
there were cutoffs for each round to move onto the next round, but I didn&rsquo;t
hit any.</p>

    <h2>Sprints</h2>

<p>5 sprints through a 6-cone serpentine, finishing each with a sprint to the start. 2min rest between sprints.</p>

<p>My times: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">13.07</span>, <span class="number">12</span>:<span class="number">45</span>, <span class="number">12</span>:<span class="number">11</span>, <span class="number">12</span>:<span class="number">04</span>, <span class="number">12</span>:<span class="number">11</span> </span>. 12:04 was also the class record. I tried several times to beat it but couldn&rsquo;t quite do it. I also ran
one lap at 11:37 but we&rsquo;re not counting it because I missed two cones.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>&ldquo;The Warmup WOD&rdquo;"</p>

<p>15min AMRAP:</p>

<ul>
<li>25m High Knees</li>
<li>25m Butt Kicks</li>
<li>10m of Inch Worms (no push up)</li>
<li>20 Walking Lunge Steps</li>
<li>10 KB Swings</li>
<li>10 Goblet Squats</li>
</ul>


<p>I used a 44lb KB for the swings and squats. Got through 4 rounds + everything up to KB swings on the 5th round. Could have probably banged out the swings
and squats if I&rsquo;d had another 40 seconds or so.</p>

<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>I was the only person in the class, and we had some spare time at the end, so I worked on bar muscle ups. I ended up doing one clean muscle up on the bar -
possibly my first ever that I did with good form.</p>
