    <p>Played two games against fairly weak teams to win Woodbridge league. Our
team is pretty stacked, so it made the games lopsided. We were just shy of
scoring a combined 100 points between both games.</p>

    <p>Started our first game with only 3 people. Had to pick up some friends for
the first half, until reinforcements arrived. Ended up losing by a couple.
Second game was closer and more intense. We won in OT after they had the
disc to win bun turned it over.</p>

<p>In general, I thought we played pretty poorly (probably not a popular
sentiment). Lots of high risk throws and turnovers. Some of the risky stuff
worked (Including the winning throw of the last game), but it&rsquo;s not a
sustainable way of playing.</p>

    <p>A bit of ultimate, skiils and frolf in good ol Troy. I did decent in the pull comp but sucked at TRC and accuracy. The weather was cold but
decent, the partys were both some of the best that we&rsquo;ve thrown, and Diana had fun the whole time (except frolf), so I&rsquo;ll count the weekend
a victory.</p>

<p>I did most of my sets at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">85</span>lb </span>. My main issue was that I didn&rsquo;t extend my hips well enough and didn&rsquo;t keep the bar close to my body,

    <p>Our closest Woodbridge game yet. We went down a few points early, then clawed our way back to win by a couple. The endzones were really
shallow this time, so the deep game was limited. We threw a lot of difficult throws that were turns, and didn&rsquo;t play defense that well.
Granted, much of our team was hung over from Bosco&rsquo;s wedding the night before and from various other Halloween parties.</p>

    <p>Played a really fun goaltimate tournament in Boston. The tourney was really high-level - all elite club players who play a lot of goalty. I
started out playing pretty poorly but learned a lot and got significantly better throughout the day. Our team lost all our games, but then
we played a few hours of pickup, which was even better than the games.</p>

<p>The main things I learned are that the easiest way to score is to get the disc in front of the goal, in the middle. Then have one person
stand behind the scoring circle (a few feet back). This forces their defender to choose to look at them or the thrower. It also makes sure
they can&rsquo;t hang out in the middle, and have to either play tight on you (which lets you cut in for the goal) or play loose, which lets the
thrower throw it over them to you. You can also score by making a horizontal cut behind the goal into the scoring space. In general, as with
ultimate, its easiest to score by cutting into the space where you want the disc, not by already being there.</p>

<p>After the tourney, we went to a space-themed Halloween party, played a bunch of flipcup, ate delicious pie, and hoverboarded on PK&rsquo;s balance
board. I got home after 3am.</p>

    <p>Another strong finish by the Rockford Peaches in fall league, though we played quite poorly in our second game. The guys didn&rsquo;t have many
subs, so our rotation was pretty tight. Our decision-making got really bad in the second game, especially towards the end. There was a
10-minute stretch right out of half where neither team scored a goal. We even called a timeout to talk about reining in our throws and going
for the easy ones, but then kept making bad choices even after that. In the end, we did manage to turn down the aggresiveness and score some
easy, patient goals. It also helped that the other team was missing Bosco, their best player.</p>

<p>Since Halloween is on Saturday, we all dressed up as the Peaches - pink dresses, red socks and hats. Our team was the best-dressed of the
evening.</p>

<li>6,4,2,4,3 Front Squat (rest 1:30 after each set)</li>

Pullups were pretty weak. I think I only did
3-4 each time. Was feeling pretty sore from earlier.</p>

<p>For Time - 8:00 Cap</p>

<ul>
<li>21,15,9 Front Squats</li>

<p><span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">4</span>:<span class="number">17</span> </span> with <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">85</span>lb </span> for front squats.</p>

<p>I scaled the pullups down to 15,12,9 because I didn&rsquo;t think I could do 21-15-9 fast, and the goal was to go fast and not struggle too much.
It ended up being basically exactly right. I do wish I knew that Rx weight for squats was 95. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I could have done that.</p>

got really tired at the end. Our team was lacking most of our strong players, and we didn&rsquo;t play very well at first. Eventually we got our

<p>The coaches told me that I tend to come up on my toes during the squat. I took my sneakers off and went barefoot for the last few sets,

    <p>Two games, two very different results. First game, we smoked our opponents. We scored twice as many points as they did, which is pretty
difficult to do in indoor. We were even missing our first-round guy, and started off with almost no guy subs because many of our guys were
running late. Still, we played well, moved the disc to the break side easily, and got a lot of Ds.</p>

<p>Second game, the exact opposite. We started off pretty weak and went down 5-1. After a timeout, we refocused and picked up our game, but we
still struggled with poor spacing and unforced mistakes. Our opponents backed us hard and forced us to cut under, which we did. But we moved
the disc to the open side too readily and got stuck in the black hole corner too often. People didn&rsquo;t stay out of the endzone, so scoring
was also difficult. And on turns, our defense was lacking. We did close the gap to 3 points at the very end, but they were in control the
whole time and milked the clock nicely to end the game.</p>

    <p>After lot of team shifts and last-minute scrambling for players, we scraped together a squad to send to Clambake. I only knew half the team
going into the weekend, but they turned out to be a great bunch. We also had people drop and pick up as the tourney progressed. We ended up
winning all our pool games and making it all the way to semis before Silence of the Clams knocked us out. The weekend was cold and windy on
the whole, so a lot of games were upwind-downwind turnoverfests. Our &ldquo;bobbing for shots&rdquo; game went over really well during the day. The game
didnt make it to the party because we went hard pretty early and lost focus.</p>
