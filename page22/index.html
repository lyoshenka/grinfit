    <p>Gorgeous day outside. Snuck in a quick workout with Diana at the highrises:</p>

<ul>
<li>2x5x single-leg lateral hops. Focus on sticking the landing.</li>
<li>2x5x shuffle-and-hops. Same as single-leg hops, but take one shuffle-step, then hop.</li>
<li>Several starts with feet parallel, then with facing 90 degrees to a side.</li>
<li>6x10secs 5yd shuffle, 30secs between reps.</li>
<li>3x10cut drill, 90secs between reps.</li>
<li>5 min tired throwing. Ended with 10 crisp backhands, 10 crisp flicks, 5 hammers.</li>

    <p>Two hours of scrimmage with fairly few people. The O line had one guy sub and one girl sub. The D line started with a girl sub but ended up savage by the end. This probably contributed to how well I thought the O line played, but we played well even in the beginning. The D line spent most of the game pulling to us. Each of our goals was worth half a point, but we could double-score after each goal to earn the full point. I really enjoyed just playing a lot with few subs. It&rsquo;s rare that I get a lot of reps in a row, and we really got into a good groove on O. I can see how having no subs at all would be rough, but I still enjoyed the day.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A pretty good 5-hour practice. We some skills work and scrimmaged a lot. We spent a good amount of time focusing on our redzone offense. We worked on the gravity cut, which turns out to be very hard to defend if you&rsquo;re close to the endzone. The third cut (to the cone, back across for the break, then force side to the back cone) is especially tricky to cover. If you don&rsquo;t sell out to get the IO, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to throw something in that area. If you do, the cut to the back cone is open. Doing this drill on O and on D really let us experiment with making the cut different ways and defending it different ways, and it really proved to me how hard it is to cover (if the thrower is close enough).</p>

<p>After that, we went into some endzone-focused scrimmage. The O line really struggled here, and the D line played very well on D and on O. They were very smooth, only had one cut at a time to each threatening space, and broke the mark very well for goals. The O line had trouble scoring more than 2 or 3 in a row, and often the goals were quite contested. We were very frustrated towards the end of practice.</p>

<p>For our last drill, worked on a bit of transition O/D in the redzone. Here, the success of the lines swapped and the O line crushed it. Maybe it helped that it started to rain and the disc became very slippery, but the O line scored almost all their opportunities and got a good amount of Ds as well.</p>

<p>My takeaways from the practice are:</p>

<ul>
<li>We should be way better about scoring in the redzone. It makes sense to isolate one cutter and look at them for a while, esp when the thrower is close to the endzone.</li>
<li>Our O needs to figure out whats going on with us. Possession and scoring should be easy, yet we struggle so much.</li>
<li>Mixing up the O/D lines may be useful. I know the argument for &ldquo;chemistry&rdquo; among the lines, but there are significant benefits to variety (more creativity, a stronger requirement for communication, more practice adapting to novel situations, learning from more players, etc) and these may outweigh the chemistry thing.</li>
</ul>

    <p>We were supposed to scrimmage at Penn Park for two hours, but they shut the lights off after about 30 minutes of playing. So we worked on our deep hucks in the dark instead. The cutting practice (the shape, the turn, not slowing down while looking back) was great. The throwing part would have been great but I was rushed to throw the next throw and not being able to see your throw was really weird.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I did the shuffles workout:</p>

<ul>
<li>4x10secondsx5yards side shuffle with crossover on the first step out of the turn</li>
<li>2x10cut drill, again with crossover on the first step</li>

<p>Threw for about a minute between each shutle.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>Spent about 10 minutes working on my throws. Primarily worked on the full-extension backhand fake to the flick throw. I have trouble getting power when coming all the way back from a full step-out. Watching Melanie throw, I noticed that she doesn&rsquo;t pivot the full 180 degrees on the way back. She goes about 135, with her right foot out in front of her left. That seemed to help, will try it next time. Also, gotta throw the disc more up and IO when reaching far or pivoting hard.</p>

    <p>An hour of 3-on-3 with the South/West Philly Amp crew. We did 3 minutes on, 3 minutes off. The weather was really hot and the turf at Penn Park made it even hotter, so the pace of the game was not the highest. Still, it was good practice. My throws and cuts were somewhat lazy at times, but other times I played strong D and cut well. I did have a few bad turnovers, still not focusing on my decisions enough.</p>

<p>After mini, I did this week&rsquo;s shuffles (8x10secondsx5yards, 30seconds rest inbetween) with Bulb and Diana. I focused on staying light on my feet in the middle and exploding out of the plants at the ends.</p>

    <p>Two days of hiking and camping in the North Cascades. We hiked about 10 miles the first day, 13 miles the second. I was pretty sore the first day and held down the back of the line. On Tueday I felt better and mostly hung in the middle. Luckily the rain held off until right after we got back to the cars.</p>

<p>There weren&rsquo;t many people on the hike, but we did see a group on horseback (lots of horse camps in the area) and several animals (many pika, a marmot and even a bear).</p>

    <p>Two days of camping and ultimate in beautiful Burlington, WA. This was basically mini-Nationals, as the top 8 teams from last year were there. A lot of unexpected results on the weekend - Drag'n Thrust only won 2 games, Cosa Nostra played better than expected, we finally beat Wildcard. On the whole though, we performed below expectations and finished last (8th) despite our wins against Wildcard and Mischief.</p>

<p>I played fairly well, though I did have some bad turnovers in the Cosa game and in our second Wildcard game. I also only played 2 points against Cosa and in our first Wildcard game. In the games that I had time to get into, I thought my cutting was fairly strong and my D on the turn was also good.</p>

<p>Things I did well:</p>

<ul>
<li>inside breaks</li>
<li>threatening deep, then cutting hard under (break and open), then slashing for the IO</li>
<li>patience near the endzone</li>
</ul>


<p>Things to improve on:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce bad decision throws. I only had two or so, but that&rsquo;s two unnecessary risks.</li>
<li>reduce execution mistakes. Had at least three here (two to Trey in the same point, probably tired mistakes). I&rsquo;ve been working on throwing harder, I think that will help.</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t get caught looking away from the guy I&rsquo;m covering. Focus on him and my footwork, but take peeks when I can. Even when I&rsquo;m peeking, move to cover the likely next threat.</li>
<li>better around breaks, flick hucks.</li>

    <p>Long day of practice with AMP: 9am-1pm, then break for lunch, then 2pm-5pm. On top of that it rained for most of the day, which sapped some of my energy towards the end. I felt great until about 3 or 4, then started to feel drained. I think a lot of the O was feeling similar, and it showed in our game.</p>

<p>I played really well before lunch, throwing or catching most of our goals and only turning over one drop and a huck to Katie. After lunch, I was not as effective with my cutting and had some poor decisions on O and D.</p>

<p>One mistake I consistently make is to not anticipate where my person is going and to allow them to beat me deep. I think part of it is that I need to try setting up differently - maybe facing the open side and dictating instead of facing the person I&rsquo;m covering and reacting.</p>

    <p>Midweek practice with AMP. We did a short warmup, then did the gauntlet D positioning drill, then went to scimmaging.</p>

<p>Most of the time, we scrimmaged with the same format as the camping weekend: D pulls to O, O sets up on D on the endzone line. If O scores, they play D. If D scores, that&rsquo;s it. The playing was fun, but it was O that struggled a lot this time. We played well but made execution mistakes and didn&rsquo;t get them back. On the few times we got them back, we turned it over again. I don&rsquo;t think we got more than one or two breaks the whole time.</p>

<p>In the last 20 minutes, we tried a new format. Neither team was allowed to score within the first 30 seconds of their possession. The endzone was considered out of bounds. After a turn, the 30 seconds restarted. The goal is to encourage the D to play aggressive underneath defense (as teams do to us sometimes) and for the O to be chilly and really work to maintain possession. At first this was a fun twist. Several points went by with both teams being patient and swinging the disc among the handlers near the endzone until it was time to score. However, the D soon realized that they needed to shut down the dumps to prevent the easy strategy. Also we got tired of the longer points. The two factors combined to create a lot of stress, and the frustration really showed for both teams. The last point took about 10 minutes to end, with both teams having multiple drops (sometimes first-throw drops) and really struggling to assert themselves. Part of this was because we really emphasize pushing upfield and not throwing backwards, but once we got to the goal line and couldnt advance, we got stuck and didn&rsquo;t adjust well. Another part is that we need to practice being flexible and communicating on the field to solve problems. Finally, we have work to do in frustration management department.</p>

<p>Looking forward to double practice this weekend.</p>

    <p>Did the first of the new BenJ workouts with Ben at penn park.</p>

<h2>Shuttles</h2>

<ul>
<li>2x150m with 50m cones: about <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span> seconds </span> each</li>
<li>4x150m with 25m cones: about <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">27</span> seconds </span> each</li>
</ul>


<p>150 seconds rest between each rep. We threw during some of the rests but forgot during others.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>Mel showed up during the end of our shuttles and we threw for about 15 min. I worked on my flick throws - trying to get them smooth, flat and high enough.</p>

<h2>Lateral Shuffles</h2>

<ul>
<li>4x10m shuffles with 15 seconds on, 45 seconds rest</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pickup</h2>

<p>Played half an hour or so of pickup in the park. It was not very high-level but a few good players were there so I got to cover them.</p>

    <p>Played two games at summer league finals. We were in E/F pool and were not taking things very seriously. We played fairly well in the first game and won by a few points. In the second game, I think we came into it hoping to lose and it showed in our playing. We also let them pick up Whitney, which didn&rsquo;t help our cause. Regardless, I had fun hanging out and taking Sunday off.</p>

    <p>We lost 15-13. Just like las year. Just like two years before that. 15-13 is my least-favorite score. The thing is that we actually played pretty well this time too. I don&rsquo;t remember too many stupid decisions. But we did dig ourselves into a hole early on and could not climb back out of it. Mott and Quinn both played very well, skying pretty much everyone on PTA repeatedly. Isaac and Swilson talked a big game, but I was underwhelmed by their play (though Swilson was solid on D). Having Paul and Tache back was a plus, but Adam and Dustin were out with injuries. Maybe we&rsquo;ll get our shit together next year.</p>

    <p>First game of Mercer finals was a typical Roots finals game. We went up a few, couldn&rsquo;t close, and lost 19-18. We played well for the most part on both O and D. Our O line was especially strong in the second half, scoring most goals quickly and efficiently. Our D was solid, though we didn&rsquo;t get many takeaways. We also struggled to convert our Ds, sometimes having multiple-turn points where we had trouble getting downfield cuts. Noah was really big for us, as were Quinn and Mott. I had one turn on an IO break flick that went over my reciever&rsquo;s head. Otherwise I played decently well, though my D was not the best. I need to focus more on my guy and work on my footwork more.</p>
