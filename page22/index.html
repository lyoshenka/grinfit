    <p>Did the first of the new BenJ workouts with Ben at penn park.</p>

<h2>Shuttles</h2>

<ul>
<li>2x150m with 50m cones: about <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span> seconds </span> each</li>
<li>4x150m with 25m cones: about <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">27</span> seconds </span> each</li>
</ul>


<p>150 seconds rest between each rep. We threw during some of the rests but forgot during others.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>Mel showed up during the end of our shuttles and we threw for about 15 min. I worked on my flick throws - trying to get them smooth, flat and high enough.</p>

<h2>Lateral Shuffles</h2>

<ul>
<li>4x10m shuffles with 15 seconds on, 45 seconds rest</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pickup</h2>

<p>Played half an hour or so of pickup in the park. It was not very high-level but a few good players were there so I got to cover them.</p>

    <p>Played two games at summer league finals. We were in E/F pool and were not taking things very seriously. We played fairly well in the first game and won by a few points. In the second game, I think we came into it hoping to lose and it showed in our playing. We also let them pick up Whitney, which didn&rsquo;t help our cause. Regardless, I had fun hanging out and taking Sunday off.</p>

    <p>We lost 15-13. Just like las year. Just like two years before that. 15-13 is my least-favorite score. The thing is that we actually played pretty well this time too. I don&rsquo;t remember too many stupid decisions. But we did dig ourselves into a hole early on and could not climb back out of it. Mott and Quinn both played very well, skying pretty much everyone on PTA repeatedly. Isaac and Swilson talked a big game, but I was underwhelmed by their play (though Swilson was solid on D). Having Paul and Tache back was a plus, but Adam and Dustin were out with injuries. Maybe we&rsquo;ll get our shit together next year.</p>

    <p>First game of Mercer finals was a typical Roots finals game. We went up a few, couldn&rsquo;t close, and lost 19-18. We played well for the most part on both O and D. Our O line was especially strong in the second half, scoring most goals quickly and efficiently. Our D was solid, though we didn&rsquo;t get many takeaways. We also struggled to convert our Ds, sometimes having multiple-turn points where we had trouble getting downfield cuts. Noah was really big for us, as were Quinn and Mott. I had one turn on an IO break flick that went over my reciever&rsquo;s head. Otherwise I played decently well, though my D was not the best. I need to focus more on my guy and work on my footwork more.</p>

    <p>Played a close and intense summer league game against Norm&rsquo;s team. They have a good team - they were missing their best guy and girl and we still had a really hard time against them. Pretty much the whole game, we were within 1 or 2 points of each other. We got the first break, but they got it back a few points later. They took half 8-7 and we traded till 11-10 or so. Then we scored several breaks to bring it to 14-12, but they came back to 14s. Finally we closed the game out 15-14.</p>

<p>We played the same way we usually play - slow in the first half, then better in the second half. We did switch to a backhand force for the second half and our girls bracketed and clogged the open side more too. If only we can come out strong in the first half, we&rsquo;d have a much better record.</p>

<p>After the game, we had a great turnout at Edgely grilling. Both Pops and I had our birthdays today, and playing Norm made it even better. A lot of people from both teams came out, plus a few other teams joined our party too. There were sausages, chicken, cheesecake, pie, and plenty of beer. We didn&rsquo;t get home till after midnight.</p>

    <a class="js-collapse" itemprop="name">Double Practice + Camping</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Had a great double practice at glorious Lums Pond State Park. We spent a lot of time scrimmaging and working on the triangle cutting drill. We focused on defense, throwing deep early, and threatening multiple spaces at once. I really enjoyed the triangle cutting drill. I think it simulated game situations well and really let us work on a lot of good habits.</p>

<p>The O-line motto for the weekend was &ldquo;play with tempo and trust&rdquo;. Miggs was coming back from surgery, so he provided feedback to the O line. I thought he was very helpful in setting the strategy (even the defensive strategy) and on giving individual feedback on throwing.</p>

<p>The O line won most of the scrimmages over the weekend. The format of the scimmages was this: if O scored the first goal, they would play defense as if it were a turn. If D scored the first goal, the point ended. Also, O never pulled to D. Instead, we would drop the disc in the endzone and then set up before checking the disc in. This was an interesting format, as it allowed the O to score twice before subs, but it also gave the D a chance to score while O was tired. I&rsquo;m not sure if this gave O an advantage or not, but the O line won most of the scrimmages on the weekend.</p>

<p>On the O line&rsquo;s O possessions, we tended to run sidestack or ho stack on the pull plays. On D, we ran aggressive marks (flat-no-inside or even straight-up at times) and tight D downfield. Half the time, we fronted the cutters and trusted the mark to take away the easy deep throw. Alex and Diana really punished us for this strategy, so we tried to play back-hip when they had the disc. When Diana came over to the O line, it became easier for us.</p>

<p>Personally, I think both my D and O really stepped up this weekend. Patrick&rsquo;s article on perfect positioning really came in handy. I spent a lot of time thinking about avoiding parallel foot positioning and I think that helped me respond to cutters faster. I covered Papa for most of the weekend. In the past I struggled to contain him, but this weekend I think I shut him down pretty often. One thing that Jill pointed out to me is that I spend too much time looking at the thrower and not enough time focusing on the person I&rsquo;m covering. I&rsquo;ll be working on that later this week. I also felt that my mark was pretty solid most of the weekend and my cutting is getting better as I practice it more.</p>

<p>My main downside is still my throwing. I don&rsquo;t think I had more than one or two decision errors, but I did have a bunch of execution mistakes. I rushed several throws when my mark was out of position or on the ground, and ended up turning them over. I even got handblocked once. I also overthrew Panna on what should have been a wide-open goal. Finally, I rushed the last point of the last game on Sunday and threw a dicey upline throw when I should have been looking to swing the disc.</p>

<h2>Camping</h2>

<p>Between Saturday and Sunday practices, we camped at the campground in the park. The forecast called for rain all weekend, but it ended up only raining at night. Saturday was beautiful the whole day. Sunday was grey and soggy, but almost no actual rain fell on us.</p>

<p>At the campsite, we played disc golf and ate a bunch of food. Alex brought a giant steam pot and made a huge dinner for everyone: 15 lobsters and a ton of clams, mussels, shrimp, sausage, eggs, etc. It was the most gourmet meal I&rsquo;ve ever had while camping. Then we sat around a campfire, drank beer, and played games. It would have been perfect if not for the nasty park ranger who made us pour out the last of our beer. I thought she was gonna be cool about it (we weren&rsquo;t even being loud) but she was not fun at all.</p>

<p>Diana and I did make one technical error. We set up our tent on a giant tarp. I thought it was a good idea, but I forgot that tent tarps are designed not to stick out past the edges of the tent. This keeps rainwater from pooling on the tarp. So when it rained at night, the water collected inside and most of our stuff got wet. We slept fine (the thermarests kept us out of the water) but packing up in the morning was annoying and drying everything in the evening was a chore. On the plus side, we had tons of dry socks because our AMP socks had just come in. I had them in my bucket, which kept them and most of my other stuff dry. The duffel bag did not stay fully dry, but it did OK compared to Diana&rsquo;s backpack, which got completely soaked. Lessons learned there.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Another awesome Wildwood is in the books. Random friends were seen, beach ultimate was played, beers were shotgunned, and we even a trophy. Here&rsquo;s how it went down.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>I started the weekend by fooling everyone into thinking that I&rsquo;m now the TD of wildwood. The crew asked me to send an email to every player at the tourney to tell them some useful info (be respectful, no glass on the beach, watch out for plainclothes cops, etc). But the way it came off, it was like I was making the announcement, and that&rsquo;s usually the TD&rsquo;s job. All weekend people came up to me asking about cops and saying they didn&rsquo;t know I was in charge of wildwood now. I set most of them straight, but sometimes it was easier to just go with it.</p>

<p>Friday was also the start of our weekend-long game of Gems. Everyone started with 5 gems, and whoever had the most by the end of the weekend got to keep the trophy. People were flipcupping for gems, betting gems (I won 3 on an arm wrestle between Diana and Katie), and even giving gems away for things. It definitely spiced the weekend up.</p>

<p>After pregaming at the house, we head for the Bolero. We danced for a bit, then bounced and went for ice cream and skinny-dipping in the ocean. The water was surprisingly warm, and the ice cream was surprisingly good - vanilla with strawberries on top. That sobered us up some, so we went home to party some more.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>Our theme for the weekend was a bit unusual: you must wear (at most) one article of clothing and it must cover your back. We had some interesting choices - dresses, panda suits, wrestling singlets, full-body spandex suits, even a kimono. I went with a fullbody suit on Saturday and a dress on Sunday. The suit was a big hit, and not all that bad to play in. I thought it would be super-hot (it was) and that throwing in those gloves would be tough (it wasn&rsquo;t). We spent most of the day drinking and chilling with people. We won all our games (both Troyalty and Troylettes) without too much of a struggle. One of the teams we played was solid, but we stepped our game up and won by 4, our closest win of the day.</p>

<p>The party was quite good this year, mostly because we didn&rsquo;t spend too much time at the Bolero. We pregamed at the house, then went out. Robb and I went ahead of the rest, and we went straight to the Rabs party room by the pool. When we migrated to the Bolero dancefloor, Diana was already there. We spent maybe 5 min inside, then went back to the Rabs room and to the pool area. After much socializing and big-containering and dice-gaming, our thoughts turned to food and we went to buy way more Chinese than we needed (though Singapore noodles were delicious). We ate on the steps near our house, then went in for the afterparty and for bedtime.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>Sunday went pretty similar to Saturday. The teams we played were better, but we were never down on points. Our two-pointers were decent, our guys were very solid, and our ladies carried the day as usual. I thought we&rsquo;d have trouble against Esser&rsquo;s team, but we went up big and they didn&rsquo;t manage to catch up in time. In the finals, we played Max Power, a Canadian team that played in Borocay and other beach tournaments. We talked them into playing Pick-6, which turned out great. I ran back a pick-6 for a goal, then threw a pick-6 Callahan shortly afterwards. Our first game to 7 was closer than it should have been. I threw a 2-pointer at 5-5 to win it, but it could have gone either way. Our second game was not as tight. I think we won 7-3 or 7-2. After the games, I played an awesome spirit game of 1-on-1 hockey in the sand. We each had a tiny hockey stick and the puck was a tennis ball. I lost my game, then Diana played one of their girls and lost as well. But we did drink tasty Canadian whiskey, so really everyone won.</p>

<p>Troylettes lost their second game on Sunday, so they were done at this point. There was nothing left to do but collect the trophy, take some photos, and then count our gems. We met back at the house and went through the final calculations. After much trading and consolidating, Stefan and I were the clear leaders. It was very close, and we each did some shots and promised some things to get the last few. We&rsquo;re now both wearing our costumes to FGiving, and I owe Steve a cheesesteak next time I&rsquo;m in Troy. In the end, I had two gems more than Stefan so I took home the MVP title and the trophy. I like to think of it as being voted &ldquo;most entertaining&rdquo; by the team.</p>

<p>Lessons for next year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gems game was great, but the small gems were annoying.</li>
<li>Prepare a spirit game. They are very fun.</li>
<li>Team theme for next year: fun police.</li>
<li>Robb should be in charge of swag.</li>

    <p>Our mid-week AMP practice was cut short by a thunderstorm, but not before the D line kicked the O line&rsquo;s ass in several short scrimmages. We struggled with downfield cutting and the dump sets. Our D after a turn was also pretty bad. That&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p>

    <p>Ran a few drills with Devlin and Glazer before our game. Did the 10-cut drill 3 times, then did the triangle cutting drill (cut deep, cut under, slash break, cut deep again, all while watching the throwing and cutting off their fakes) 2 times each on the forehand and backhand side.</p>

<p>Then played all but one point in our 15-14 loss to Rosso&rsquo;s team. We played quite poorly across the board, with everyone having bad turnovers and other mistakes (Betsy dropped the pull). Yet we still managed to get a bunch of breaks and win the insanely long points we played. We went up a break at 11-10, they got the break back at 13s, and then it was universe point. We even got the D fairly close to their endzone, but could not convert. They scored for the win.</p>

<p>After the game we had a good showing at team hangout. I drank two smoothies from the smoothie truck (one before the game, one after) and ate a bunch of Paella from Bulb&rsquo;s team.</p>

    <p>Just finished my first 24-hour fast. It was not dificult at all. I felt hungry most of the time, but it was never too distracting or annoying. I was inspired to do it after reading Eat, Stop, Eat. The author does a pretty good job analyzing the existing medical research on fasting and makes a bunch of points that seem to make sense. Hopefully it works out for me. Time to devour this burrito.</p>

    <p>Had a short throw session with Diana and Raha at Clark Park. We did 10-throw twice through. We didn&rsquo;t stand too far from each other, just focused on reps and pushing our limits. We threw a lot of throws at full extension or as high/low as we could release them. We even threw scoobers and lefty backhands. Those should come in handy at Wildwood next weekend.</p>

    <p>A tight summer league game against Trey&rsquo;s team. We played really well in the first half were up two breaks at halftime. In the second half, we had a bunch of unforced short-field turnovers and they won 15-11. We still played solid defense, but could not overcome all the mistakes. In general, our O was strong when we didn&rsquo;t turn it early. We did a good job opening up space in the middle of the field for the players who were being left uncovered. They then worked it to each other and marched the disc up the field into the endzone. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how we did, especially considering that Jeff, Katie and Diana were not playing (though we picked up Yoli to take Diana&rsquo;s spot).</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Second workout of the day. I skipped out on most of the sprints, shuttles and hill sprints because I lifted earlier. Instead I threw with Gabe and Maddie. Then I worked on defensive positioning and threw some more.</p>

<p>For the record, here&rsquo;s the workout:</p>

<h2>20m Sprints</h2>

<p>Do a bunch of 20m sprints with different starts. Start facing different directions, loading one leg or the other, leaning forwards, stepping backwards, etc. My favorite was to set up as if you&rsquo;re covering someone in the stack and have them cut in while you chase. If the defender beats the cutter to the line, they win a prize (in this case, a chicken wing). Rest for full recovery between sprints.</p>

<p>I skipped everything but the O-D sprints.</p>

<h2>Shuttles</h2>

<p>Sprint 50m, do 5 side-to-side shuffles between two cones, sprint 50m, shuffle again, sprint 50m. Not sure what the rest is, I&rsquo;d do 1-2min.</p>

<h2>Hill Sprints</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t see what they did because I was throwing, but I did discover that Penn Park has some nice short hills to sprint up.</p>

<h2>Defense Drill</h2>

<p>Did Nick&rsquo;s box drill several times. Worked on focusing on my defenders hips, staying close to them and being on the correct side of them. Also on my footwork. Papa pointed out that on Amp, we tend to spend a lot of time watching the disc when our person is not active. That&rsquo;s important, but we should be spending more time watching our person and only glancing at the disc momentarily to get an idea of what&rsquo;s going on. This will let us react faster to our person making a move, and we&rsquo;ll be closer on the D.</p>

    <p>Played several hours of goalty with Amp. We played 5v5 for most of the time, then switched to 4v4 at the end. I&rsquo;m completely sold on the clear box vs the clear line. The box encourages you to play defense the whole time, not just near the goal.</p>
