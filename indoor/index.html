    <p>Another indoor double header. Won our first game handily, then eked out a last-second win on universe in the finals. Zoya came again. She’s
getting a lot of ultimate-watching in. Hope it rubs off on her (just the good stuff though).</p>

    <p>Brought Zoya to her first ultimate game. Found some parents on the sideline who agreed to watch her while I played. She was great - no more
stranger danger, all smiles and giggles. Our team crushed the other team, who was on the second game of their double-header and didn’t have
many subs. Afterwards, we went out to lunch.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two solid indoor games. The first was against UConn (Liz/Saipher/Mary/others). We didn’t play well (start off down 5-1) and the game was
quite chippy overall. We eventually clawed our way into the game, switched to backhand to prevent their easy hammer scores, and went up a
few points at the end. As time was running out, we buckled down and closed it out to win by 2.</p>

<p>The second game was the best game of the season. We played Colt/Baywatch. They were the favorite, with lots of solid club guys and
a deep roster. They only had two women, and we tried to take advantage of that, but I think it was pretty even. The whole game was very
close and very spirited. We forced middle the whole game (props to Bosco for the brilliant idea) and made sure we were subbing super fast.
We even created two subbing groups for the second half to make sure our lines were well-balanced.</p>

<p>I think the force middle really got to them, because their offence (normally very fast-paced and trigger-happy) slowed down a lot. We often
forced them to throw 20 or even 30 throws before they could score. Big props to the improved defense from everyone. On offense, Shockey
dominated. He probably scored half our goals that game. Bosco started throwing him floaty dimeballs, and eventually I found my stride and hit
him on a few nice hucks too. I think he only got beat in the air once.</p>

<p>When time ran out in the second half, the score was 20-20. They had just scored, so we decided it would be a universe-point game with us on
offense. We subbed in our best line and started working the disc. After 3 throws, Bosco unleashes a floaty hammer to CJ for the win. It
floats a bit too long, and gets D-ed toward me. I catch it and throw CJ game-winner. A very exciting end to a very good game.</p>

<h3 id="team-wins">Team Wins</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Force middle. Damn smart.</li>
  <li>We finally subbed at the right pace. I’m just as guilty of staying on too long as anyone. I’m happy we finally did it right.</li>
  <li>Great execution on the force middle. Sideline presence was strong and got everyone into the game. Several people had never played FM
before, but they did a great job figuring it out and implementing it. I’d say this was the biggest factor in our win.</li>
  <li>Strong deep game from Andy/Shockey. Really kept us in the game.</li>
  <li>Excellent spirit from both teams.</li>
  <li>Free beer for us after the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="personal-wins">Personal Wins</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Reeled in my bad throws from the first game, threw better deep looks in the second game.</li>
  <li>D was on point. Got a nice layout D on Timmer in the endzone, an almost-handblock, and generally played my guy tight (plus ran some nice switches).</li>
  <li>Biggest win was the last point. Not that I saved the hammer or threw the goal, but that I made myself get in position to clean up the
trash. When I’m tired, I take mental shortcuts and just hope that things will work out. I clearly remember thinking “oh, I don’t need to
back CJ up. either he’ll catch it or its a D”. And my next thought was “well, I can get close enough for a small chance at a second
attempt”. And that’s exactly what happened, and it won us the game. This mental weakness has been a point of internal struggle for a
while, and I won that struggle today.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="needs-improvement">Needs Improvement</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Still too risky/inconsistent with my deep throws.</li>
  <li>Need to learn to better recognize when someone is open or not. I’ve been hesitant on some throws to open players, when I should be hitting
them.</li>
  <li>Starting giving-and-going towards the end, but still not natural.</li>

    <p>Lost two close games to finish 4th for the season. Both were solid games.
My highlights: got bunch of nice Ds, esp in the second game. Also completed
two skipsies for goals (out of three attempts). Lowlights: still more turns
than I’d like (esp first game) and some weak defense at times. I also could
have been more aggressive as a cutter throughout.</p>

    <p>Started our first game with only 3 people. Had to pick up some friends for
the first half, until reinforcements arrived. Ended up losing by a couple.
Second game was closer and more intense. We won in OT after they had the
disc to win bun turned it over.</p>

<p>In general, I thought we played pretty poorly (probably not a popular
sentiment). Lots of high risk throws and turnovers. Some of the risky stuff
worked (Including the winning throw of the last game), but it’s not a
sustainable way of playing.</p>

    <p>Our closest Woodbridge game yet. We went down a few points early, then clawed our way back to win by a couple. The endzones were really
shallow this time, so the deep game was limited. We threw a lot of difficult throws that were turns, and didn’t play defense that well.
Granted, much of our team was hung over from Bosco’s wedding the night before and from various other Halloween parties.</p>

    <p>Another strong finish by the Rockford Peaches in fall league, though we played quite poorly in our second game. The guys didn’t have many
subs, so our rotation was pretty tight. Our decision-making got really bad in the second game, especially towards the end. There was a
10-minute stretch right out of half where neither team scored a goal. We even called a timeout to talk about reining in our throws and going
for the easy ones, but then kept making bad choices even after that. In the end, we did manage to turn down the aggresiveness and score some
easy, patient goals. It also helped that the other team was missing Bosco, their best player.</p>

<p>Since Halloween is on Saturday, we all dressed up as the Peaches - pink dresses, red socks and hats. Our team was the best-dressed of the
evening.</p>

had really nice throws that he used to find the endzone a lot. They only had one girl, but she also played very well most of the time. She
got really tired at the end. Our team was lacking most of our strong players, and we didn’t play very well at first. Eventually we got our
shit together and stopped turning it over so much.</p>

    <p>Two games, two very different results. First game, we smoked our opponents. We scored twice as many points as they did, which is pretty
difficult to do in indoor. We were even missing our first-round guy, and started off with almost no guy subs because many of our guys were
running late. Still, we played well, moved the disc to the break side easily, and got a lot of Ds.</p>

<p>Second game, the exact opposite. We started off pretty weak and went down 5-1. After a timeout, we refocused and picked up our game, but we
still struggled with poor spacing and unforced mistakes. Our opponents backed us hard and forced us to cut under, which we did. But we moved
the disc to the open side too readily and got stuck in the black hole corner too often. People didn’t stay out of the endzone, so scoring
was also difficult. And on turns, our defense was lacking. We did close the gap to 3 points at the very end, but they were in control the
whole time and milked the clock nicely to end the game.</p>

    <p>First night of fall league. Met my team, which turned out to be pretty
cool. I was told it was very top-heavy, but I think all the players are at
least decent. No one’s unathletic. We lost our first game to Bosco’s team
by 1, then beat shockey’s team by 1. Everyone played well, though some of
the newer players need some coaching. I got a decent number of Ds (mostly
poach Ds) and threw some nice goals (mostly to Kamil). Indoor is a great
workout.</p>

    <p>Played Delaware in the WL chumpionship. Our team played quite well overall, and I finally had a game where I’m happy with pretty much everything I did. I
subbed fast, I only threw one turnover, and I was fairly effective on O and D. I even threw Diana a huck for a goal and intentionally macked a hammer to
Furf for a goal (against the rules, I know, but it was awesome). I’d say the biggest difference between that game and our semis game was the feeling of
relaxation. I did not feel pressure, I did not rush my throws or decisions, everything was more relaxed and smoother. I don’t know how much of that is
because we weren’t in contention to win the league, how much was because of skill differences (Del was not bad, but they play a slower college style), how
much was something else. I will meditate on this some more.</p>

were down most of the way and went on a 6-point run at the end to bring it within 1. We were missing Furf, Raha and Diana. The game was a lot of fun.
Butter instructed me to win with my legs, and I did that fairly well (perhaps too well - I didn’t sub enough and got caught tired at moments). Ben’s
fitness seems to have helped, but I stil had some bad throwaways. Billy and Sachie played especially well, and Truskin was unstoppable in the air. I threw
the last throw - a blade to Tom in the endzone - that Owen D’ed very nicely to prevent us from going into overtime.</p>

bad throws in the 4th quarter. I also hurt my knee on a high layout in the middle of the game, but that seems to be doing better.</p>

    <p>Practice was basically the same as last week, except we also ran the 4on4 drill with defense and with live play after the drill starts. I played much
worse this time than last time - lots of bad throwaways, lack of focus. Not sure how much of it was mental - I told Billy that I’d be missing most of the
season and basically took myself off the team. He told me they were planning to offer me a contract and he’s really happy with how I’m covering handlers
and breaking the mark around (this was before the shitty practice), but now I’ll start as a practice player and maybe move onto the roster if that works
out. So now that I wasn’t in the running, I think I loosened up. Stupid placebo. Need to pretend I’m staying in Philly and still gunning for a starting
spot.</p>

    <p>Winter league against Trey’s team. We came out hot and never let up. Diana, Anna, Billy and Nick played especially well. Butter asked me before the game
to take it easy on deep shots, and I think I did an OK job of that.</p>

    <p>Played a WL game against Vanni’s team. We had all of our guys there, so I didn’t really play that much. They also weren’t that strong, so the game was
pretty relaxed for us. My fav play of the night was Robb throwing me a thumber just outside the endzone, and then me turning and throwing Billy a
Rochester for the score. Final score: 39-15</p>

    <p>Played against Bills team and Delaware in winter league. The first game was
very close and very heated, esp towards the end. We were up 1 most of the
game but they caught up in the fourth quarter, then passed us. We ended up
losing by 1 after some fouling and clock-rewinding in the last few seconds
of play. In the second game, Delaware was up the whole first half, but in
the second half we switched to flick and pulled away for a solid win. In
general, our team played solid O (though sometimes a bit huck happy or
risky) and fairly good but not excellent D. Personally I threw and caught a
bunch of goals, but also had a lot of turns on rushed goal attempts and
inside backhand breaks. Those are my two areas of focus for next time.
Brandon Silverman told me during the game that I’m really good at going to
the disc, so that’s another plus.</p>

    <p>Beat Trey’s team by 1 point in an exciting back-and-forth indoor game. We finally had our whole team. They were missing Trey, but had everyone else. They played the Trey zone with TC as the big man deep, but we were disciplined enough to work through it most of the time. We also played well on D and got a decent number of blocks on dumps to TC. He played really well and did almost everything for them. But in the end, Ashley put up a full-field buzz beater to Tom to win it.</p>

    <p>Played against the Heva Havas indoor team. They had a double header and looked pretty tired against us, so it wasn’t a tough game. But we still tried to push ourselves to play better. They did get off too many breakside hucks, and moved the disc fairly well on O. They also hucked it deep a lot, which lead to some scores but way more turnovers. Personally I threw away a bunch by putting them just a little too far in front without enough float. Need to work on throwing to space, not to the exact spot I’m looking. Also IOs still need work. Final score: 37-24.</p>

    <p>Played a full game against Delaware’s college team. They were pretty athletic and had decent throws, but their girls were not great and they didn’t have the experience we had. The game was close in the first and most of the second quarter, though it was our fault for turning over a lot of endzone opportunities. We got our shit together some more in the second half and pulled away to win by 6 or 7. I had a good amount of inside breaks for goals, but I also turned over a bunch. Butter is right, my IO flick needs work.</p>

    <p>Had a long meeting about the upcoming Amp season. We talked about the importance of player retention, changing up the practice structure (midweek practices, more intense weekends, fewer but longer weekends), focusing on cutting and on-field problem solving, tryouts and setting the roster early, and many other things. It was mostly a brainstorming session as well as a feedback-for-the-captains session. There was some disagreement about early-season tournaments and whether going to a beach weekend with a bunch of people you don’t know is a good or bad things for new players. We also talked about holding each other accountable and creating standards of fitness. Dre mentioned that every DI program she’s ever coached or played for has fitness standards, and they are a good way to force people to get in shape, but she would not advocate them for Amp because the primary goal is not to win a championship at any cost.</p>

<p>After the meeting, we went to Spinners practice. We mostly scrimmaged and worked on dump offense and defense. I threw some good throws but also had a few bad turnovers. My D was fairly good allaround. I’d give me a 7 out of 10. Or maybe 6. Need more work.</p>

    <p>Played a full 48 minutes of winter league tonight. Our team only had one sub of each gender (thanks Allie for picking up with us) so I didn’t sub at all. We got crushed, but it was still good practice for playing tired. I also came to realize that Butter is right about my flicks: the shape of the throw is off, especially on inside outs. They all end up outside ins and they don’t float at all. I threw at least two hucks that would have been goals except that they trailed away from the cutter at the end of the throw.</p>

    <p>3 hours of Phoenix tryouts at Maple Zone. We spent most of the time doing drills. The first few drills were pretty cool - 4 stations, each with a different set of cuts, and you run the cuts as fast as you can. There was a straight 40, a 10yard incut followed by a 40 deep, and two drills with 2 short cuts each. We ran each set of cuts once and were timed.</p>

<p>After the cuts, we had 4 more stations to rotate through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>baseball drill</li>
  <li>defense drill (defending an incut, break cut and deep cut, then later defending the dump)</li>
  <li>breakmark drill, then continuation cutting drill</li>
  <li>marking drill</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally at the end we got to scrimmage two games to 7. I wish we had played more, but it was still fun.</p>

    <p>Lots of utlimate tonight: core winter league at Ampro, then Spinners practice at Tee’s. I got lucky and found rides from/to everything.</p>

<h2 id="winter-league">Winter League</h2>

<p>We played a great game tonight and pulled off a strong win against a (possibly) better team. We stuck to our goals (don’t get beat to the force-side cone, always have a dump), played great defense and smart offense. We got out to an early lead and held it the whole game, never letting them come within 3 points. Thanasis and Eddie had a great game, coming up with some nice Ds and some big skies. Our ladies also did well on offense, and their defense is improving each game.</p>

<p>To be fair, Jake’s team was missing Jack Kelly and Jake was not at 100% because he’s just coming back from a long hamstring injury recovery. But I still think we played our best game yet and the improvement is very encouraging. I did not expect us to win a single game this season and had switched focus to coaching and working on fundamentals. But maybe that’s the secret?</p>

<h2 id="spinners-practice">Spinners Practice</h2>

<p>After our game, Jake and I went to the practice. We did a short warmup, some 3-man handler weaveing, a drill to work on our first step, and then some scrimmaging. We mostly worked on dumps to the open side (and dump defense). We also played 2-minute segments with no subs, alternating 5v5 and 4v4. Finally, we played a few 5-minute quarters with subs.</p>

<p>I felt pretty good throughout the practice. It was really cold at Tee’s and my hands were freezing, so my throws were not as quick or accurate as usual. But the main thing that’s holding me back right now is fitness. I gotta in better shape. Also, better footwork would be great. Ben’s first-step drills should be helpful here.</p>

    <p>Played the first game with my high schooler team. We worked on setting goals that are within our control: always having a dump and not getting beat to the force-side cone. For the first half, we didn’t have those explicit goals and we played pretty poorly. After half, our focus improved and we matched Gooch’s team point for point. But we didn’t really convert any breaks and they rode their first-half lead to the win.</p>

<p>I ended up staying to watch the second game and throw with Cuatro. Then it turned out that Norm’s team was shorthanded, so I picked up with them for my second game. They are a more experienced and disciplined team, so our game was a lot closer. Fern played especially well for us. But Drexel put together an athletic team and pulled away in the second half to secure their victory. Two losses in one night.</p>
