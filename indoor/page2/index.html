    <p>Lost two close games to finish 4th for the season. Both were solid games.
My highlights: got bunch of nice Ds, esp in the second game. Also completed
two skipsies for goals (out of three attempts). Lowlights: still more turns
than I&rsquo;d like (esp first game) and some weak defense at times. I also could
have been more aggressive as a cutter throughout.</p>

    <p>Started our first game with only 3 people. Had to pick up some friends for
the first half, until reinforcements arrived. Ended up losing by a couple.
Second game was closer and more intense. We won in OT after they had the
disc to win bun turned it over.</p>

<p>In general, I thought we played pretty poorly (probably not a popular
sentiment). Lots of high risk throws and turnovers. Some of the risky stuff
worked (Including the winning throw of the last game), but it&rsquo;s not a
sustainable way of playing.</p>

    <p>Our closest Woodbridge game yet. We went down a few points early, then clawed our way back to win by a couple. The endzones were really
shallow this time, so the deep game was limited. We threw a lot of difficult throws that were turns, and didn&rsquo;t play defense that well.
Granted, much of our team was hung over from Bosco&rsquo;s wedding the night before and from various other Halloween parties.</p>

    <p>Another strong finish by the Rockford Peaches in fall league, though we played quite poorly in our second game. The guys didn&rsquo;t have many
subs, so our rotation was pretty tight. Our decision-making got really bad in the second game, especially towards the end. There was a
10-minute stretch right out of half where neither team scored a goal. We even called a timeout to talk about reining in our throws and going
for the easy ones, but then kept making bad choices even after that. In the end, we did manage to turn down the aggresiveness and score some
easy, patient goals. It also helped that the other team was missing Bosco, their best player.</p>

<p>Since Halloween is on Saturday, we all dressed up as the Peaches - pink dresses, red socks and hats. Our team was the best-dressed of the
evening.</p>

had really nice throws that he used to find the endzone a lot. They only had one girl, but she also played very well most of the time. She
got really tired at the end. Our team was lacking most of our strong players, and we didn&rsquo;t play very well at first. Eventually we got our
shit together and stopped turning it over so much.</p>

    <p>Two games, two very different results. First game, we smoked our opponents. We scored twice as many points as they did, which is pretty
difficult to do in indoor. We were even missing our first-round guy, and started off with almost no guy subs because many of our guys were
running late. Still, we played well, moved the disc to the break side easily, and got a lot of Ds.</p>

<p>Second game, the exact opposite. We started off pretty weak and went down 5-1. After a timeout, we refocused and picked up our game, but we
still struggled with poor spacing and unforced mistakes. Our opponents backed us hard and forced us to cut under, which we did. But we moved
the disc to the open side too readily and got stuck in the black hole corner too often. People didn&rsquo;t stay out of the endzone, so scoring
was also difficult. And on turns, our defense was lacking. We did close the gap to 3 points at the very end, but they were in control the
whole time and milked the clock nicely to end the game.</p>

cool. I was told it was very top-heavy, but I think all the players are at
least decent. No one&rsquo;s unathletic. We lost our first game to Bosco&rsquo;s team
by 1, then beat shockey&rsquo;s team by 1. Everyone played well, though some of
the newer players need some coaching. I got a decent number of Ds (mostly
poach Ds) and threw some nice goals (mostly to Kamil). Indoor is a great
workout.</p>

    <p>Played Delaware in the WL chumpionship. Our team played quite well overall, and I finally had a game where I&rsquo;m happy with pretty much everything I did. I
subbed fast, I only threw one turnover, and I was fairly effective on O and D. I even threw Diana a huck for a goal and intentionally macked a hammer to
Furf for a goal (against the rules, I know, but it was awesome). I&rsquo;d say the biggest difference between that game and our semis game was the feeling of
relaxation. I did not feel pressure, I did not rush my throws or decisions, everything was more relaxed and smoother. I don&rsquo;t know how much of that is
because we weren&rsquo;t in contention to win the league, how much was because of skill differences (Del was not bad, but they play a slower college style), how
much was something else. I will meditate on this some more.</p>

    <p>Played Bill&rsquo;s Team (Rag Tag) in the semis. Lost by one point (just like the first time we played them) but the game went a bit differently. This time, we
were down most of the way and went on a 6-point run at the end to bring it within 1. We were missing Furf, Raha and Diana. The game was a lot of fun.
Butter instructed me to win with my legs, and I did that fairly well (perhaps too well - I didn&rsquo;t sub enough and got caught tired at moments). Ben&rsquo;s
fitness seems to have helped, but I stil had some bad throwaways. Billy and Sachie played especially well, and Truskin was unstoppable in the air. I threw
the last throw - a blade to Tom in the endzone - that Owen D'ed very nicely to prevent us from going into overtime.</p>

    <p>Played RABS in WL. We were close most of the way but got frantic on O in the 4th quarter and let them widen the lead for the win. We played pretty solidly
overall and adjusted well to their game (taking away the deep cuts and the around throws). I did not play that well down the stretch, throwing away some
bad throws in the 4th quarter. I also hurt my knee on a high layout in the middle of the game, but that seems to be doing better.</p>

    <p>Practice was basically the same as last week, except we also ran the 4on4 drill with defense and with live play after the drill starts. I played much
worse this time than last time - lots of bad throwaways, lack of focus. Not sure how much of it was mental - I told Billy that I&rsquo;d be missing most of the
season and basically took myself off the team. He told me they were planning to offer me a contract and he&rsquo;s really happy with how I&rsquo;m covering handlers
and breaking the mark around (this was before the shitty practice), but now I&rsquo;ll start as a practice player and maybe move onto the roster if that works
out. So now that I wasn&rsquo;t in the running, I think I loosened up. Stupid placebo. Need to pretend I&rsquo;m staying in Philly and still gunning for a starting
spot.</p>
