    <p>Practice was supposed to be Saturday, but it got rained out and moved to Sunday. We split the practice up into 4 sections: one for each of our Thursday
opponents plus one for us. During our section, we ran through all the plays in our playbook to make sure we have everything down pat. Then we played mini
to work on handler movement and stopping it (Cosa Nostra), worked on physical defense and poachy zone (7 Figures), and then scrimmaged with the endzone
being closed for the first 40 seconds (CLX). Overall the practice went pretty well. The O line especially played well during the scrimmages, coming back to
win the zone scrimmage after being down, and not giving up a single turn in the endzone-closed scrimmage.</p>

    <p>Two hours of scrimmage with fairly few people. The O line had one guy sub and one girl sub. The D line started with a girl sub but ended up savage by the end. This probably contributed to how well I thought the O line played, but we played well even in the beginning. The D line spent most of the game pulling to us. Each of our goals was worth half a point, but we could double-score after each goal to earn the full point. I really enjoyed just playing a lot with few subs. It&rsquo;s rare that I get a lot of reps in a row, and we really got into a good groove on O. I can see how having no subs at all would be rough, but I still enjoyed the day.</p>

    <p>Midweek practice with AMP. We did a short warmup, then did the gauntlet D positioning drill, then went to scimmaging.</p>

<p>Most of the time, we scrimmaged with the same format as the camping weekend: D pulls to O, O sets up on D on the endzone line. If O scores, they play D. If D scores, that&rsquo;s it. The playing was fun, but it was O that struggled a lot this time. We played well but made execution mistakes and didn&rsquo;t get them back. On the few times we got them back, we turned it over again. I don&rsquo;t think we got more than one or two breaks the whole time.</p>

<p>In the last 20 minutes, we tried a new format. Neither team was allowed to score within the first 30 seconds of their possession. The endzone was considered out of bounds. After a turn, the 30 seconds restarted. The goal is to encourage the D to play aggressive underneath defense (as teams do to us sometimes) and for the O to be chilly and really work to maintain possession. At first this was a fun twist. Several points went by with both teams being patient and swinging the disc among the handlers near the endzone until it was time to score. However, the D soon realized that they needed to shut down the dumps to prevent the easy strategy. Also we got tired of the longer points. The two factors combined to create a lot of stress, and the frustration really showed for both teams. The last point took about 10 minutes to end, with both teams having multiple drops (sometimes first-throw drops) and really struggling to assert themselves. Part of this was because we really emphasize pushing upfield and not throwing backwards, but once we got to the goal line and couldnt advance, we got stuck and didn&rsquo;t adjust well. Another part is that we need to practice being flexible and communicating on the field to solve problems. Finally, we have work to do in frustration management department.</p>

<p>Looking forward to double practice this weekend.</p>

    <p>Scrimmage at the Duck Pond. We played 4 games of 10-12 minutes. All games were 5v5 and on-the-fly subbing, but on a full field. We also added the rule that you cannot throw backwards. I played well for the most part, but had a poor flick huck again. I did have several good hucks though. I&rsquo;ll keep working on it.</p>

    <p>Played a bunch of 5v5 and then 4v4 at Haverford. Warmed up with the warning track drill, then emphasized deep cuts and deep throws to space in the scrimmages. I need to start wearing knee pads, at least on my left knee. After scrimmage, supper club at Tiffin for some Lamb Saag.</p>

    <p>The first of our regular midweek meetups. We warmed up with a bit of plyos and the give-n-go drill, then scrimmaged (5v5, then 3v3) for over an hour. It was a lot of fun. Playing with fewer players gives you way more touches and lets you feel like you&rsquo;re killing it on O because you&rsquo;re way open. On D though, its a lot tougher. I did ok for the most part. My cutting was pretty good but my deep throws were way off. Throwing higher has been helping, but now I&rsquo;m sometimes throwing too high. I guess that&rsquo;s ok for now.</p>

<p>After the game, we went to Luigi&rsquo;s Pizza in Fairmount and talked about jersey designs. I&rsquo;m starting to feel pretty good about it. They are not gonna wind up as boring as I feared.</p>
