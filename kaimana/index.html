    <p>3 days of gorgeous weather, high-level ultimate and awesome partying &hellip; or at least that&rsquo;s the pitch. Unfortunately, this year did not live up to expectations.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>The weather on Saturday was not bad. It wasn&rsquo;t sunny, but at least there was no wind and the ground was fairly dry. We played 3 teams - Maui Mana (a local team), Colony (an Australian club team preparing for worlds), and Club Prince (a Madcow-Bravo combo team). All the games were lopsided. We crushed Maui and got our ass kicked by the other two. The game against Prince was a bit closer than the other, but the finals score was 15-7 or so. We didn&rsquo;t play great.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>The weather got worse on Sunday. There was a lot of rain and the ground was very muddy by the time we played (11:45am start times today and yesterday). We played another local team and wrecked them, then played KUT (Carleton Alum) and got killed again. I skipped the second half of the first game and the first half of the second game to pick up with Ski Patrol, which made my day much more interesting. They were mostly Seattle guys with a few outside pickups (Brown, Zargham, Lucas). They play a very different style of ultimate - much more relaxed and dynamic, but still focused. I wish I&rsquo;d had more time to play with them. I did get to play half a game aginst Sofia Freaks, another unique and interesting team that I love playing against. They went up in the first half and took half 8-4. After I left, Ski Patrol rallied and won the game on universe point.</p>

<p>After pool play ended, we played a prequarter game against Stanford Bloodthirsty. The game was close the whole way, with them leading by a bit, but we got a late break and won 13-12 when the game got capped. Stanford had a great deep game and their primary handlers played very well. We sucked on D and were decent on O. Everything was pretty sloppy. We also had a 15 min break when one of the Stanford guys hurt himself. In the end, the game got capped and we scored on O to win it.</p>

<h2>Monday</h2>

<p>Winning in prequarters earned us the right to play Ono in quarters. By this point, the fields were completely torn up and muddy. The wind made the game almost unplayable (it blew over the tournament tent early that morning) and most of us had trouble throwing and catching. Ono had several strong throwers, and they were able to convert several upwind breaks, which quickly lead to downwind breaks. It was shitty all around and we lost 15-6 or so.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overall I played very well for the first two days. Ignoring the Ono game (it was terrible ultimate), I had no throwing turnovers and just one drop  - a throw from Bhavin in the endzone that should have been an easy catch but I misread it a bit and then dropped the catch. I mostly cut, but did some handling and played a bunch of defense. I&rsquo;m especially happy with my offense. Maybe playing O line for Amp is a good move.</p>

    <p>Hiked the beautiful, dangerous and slightly illegal <a href="http://unrealhawaii.com/2010/05/haiku-stairs/">Haiku Stairs</a>. That&rsquo;s 4000 steps and 2000ft to the top, plus sneaking through secret forest paths and hiding from the guards before you even get to the trail. It took us about two hours on the way up, an hour on the way down. Possibly the most scenic workout I&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>

    <p>Short day. Lost to Stigmata Clemada in quarters and there were no consolation games. On the upside, we got to watch the girls play in semis and finals. They lost in the finals to a team of mostly Fury girls but they played very well. Then we watched the men&rsquo;s finals and ate poke. Stigmata beat Ski Patrol to win it all. After games, we swam in the ocean, hit up the Kona Brewery and said bye to Hawaii. Till next year.</p>

    <p>Pretty good day. First up, we played Freaks - the Japanese team. They are all very fast and athletic and they play a different style of ultimate that I&rsquo;m used to. Instead of cuts coming primarily from the stack and toward the handlers, their first look is either to an upline handler cut or to a short cut from the front of the stack and then a leading dishie to a handler. It&rsquo;s very interesting - their momentum is always toward the endzone they are attacking and almost never away from it. This lets them always see the field and sets them up for great flow. However, no one on their team was over 6 feet tall and that really limits their deep game. They tried to throw it deep past us a few times but it rarely worked. That let us focus on taking away their short game and really limited their options. On O, we took advantage of the height mismatches and their need to back us and double/triple team us on deep cuts. I think we were up the whole game and ended up winning by 2.</p>

<p>Game 2, we played Ono. They had a bunch of ex-Condors and mostly older guys, but they were very tall and had great throws. Freaks beat Ono in the morning, but we couldn&rsquo;t do the same. We also dropped the disc 7 or 8 times for no reason at all. Not a very good game for us.</p>

<p>In pre-quarters, we played the Stanford undergrads. They had a few talented players but they couldn&rsquo;t really match up to us. The game actually ended up being a lot closer than it should have been when they made a late-game run for a few points. But the game got capped and we won 13-12.</p>

    <p>We started the tourney off with a quick loss ot UCSC Slugs Alum. I don&rsquo;t know how many of those guys actually went to UCSC, but they had some strong players from Sockeye, Chain, Subzero and some other teams. Their deep shots were money and we didn&rsquo;t play very well. Next, we beat the other two teams in our pool: Bag of Wine (the eventual spirit winner, made us 6-way funnel half a bag of wine) and Spurburry Makai (the NYC guys, only had 12 people and didn&rsquo;t play well). We also played tons of Spikeball between games. Summerspike - watch out.</p>

    <p>Kayaked for two hours on the Hanalei river. We woke up early to get some kayaking in before our flight from Kauai to Oahu. We were the first ones out there, so there wasn&rsquo;t much traffic. But we did see several 6-person outrigger canoe teams cruise by us. I had never really been taught how to kayak, so Bill gave me some good tips. To summarize: sit up, paddle smoothly and not to close to the kayak, look at the front tip for better steering feedback.</p>

    <p>Did a day hike to the <a href="http://www.everytrail.com/guide/hanakapi-ai-falls-na-pali-coast-kauai">Hanakapi'ai Falls</a> along the Na Pali Coast trail. The hike is 8 miles round trip and very muddy and up-and-down, but the view is awesome the whole time. The first two miles are along the coast. You can see the ocean, the forest, the hills and you even get to see whales sometimes (we saw one spouting water). Then you get to a small beach and head inland for another two miles of almost-rainforst. The waterfall itself is very narrow but extremely tall (300ft). Eug, Tim, Krista and I jumped in and swam under the fall to hang out on the other side. The water was quite cold but very refreshing.</p>
