    <p>In some ways the worst Wildwood yet. Cops were super annoying, got a $333 ticket for open display of alcohol. Played quite poorly most of the time.
Shrooms didn&rsquo;t do much. Diana wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>In another sense, tourney was pretty good. Weather was great - not scorching hot, not pouring rain. Cline&rsquo;s dance party at Stardust was sick. Stayed up
till 4am both nights, got quite drunk but wasn&rsquo;t hung over. Partied with lots of people I like. Played well against Rabs and Humiliswag. Saved a bunch of
money by sleeping in my car (the ppl whose house I slept in front of were not too happy). Chilled with Jennie, Barb, Robb and Max a good amount.</p>

    <p>Two days of fun in the sun with the sharkfuckers. Played 7 games with a
combined point diff of 94-45. Wasn&rsquo;t too tired because we didn&rsquo;t have that
many points to play. I had some silly turns of Sat but tightened it up on
Sunday. The finals was my best game - no turns, at least 4 assists, a
handful of Ds, and a hand block followed by a Rochester for the goal. We
won $1000, threw it in the air, swam in it naked and swaggered around as
much as we could.</p>

<p>Based on my last deadlift set (5@295), I estimated my 1RM at 345lb. So I went with <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">205</span>lb </span> for the deadlifts. It was fairly heavy but
I don&rsquo;t think I struggled on any rep. I used <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">10</span>lb </span> for the twists - definitely too light.</p>

<li>10 Hang Power Cleans, 100 Jump rope singles</li>
<li>8 Hang Power Cleans, 80 Jump rope singles</li>

<li>4 Hang Power Cleans, 40 Jump rope singles</li>
<li>2 Hang Power Cleans, 20 Jump rope singles</li>

<p>We did it as a partner workout, so my partner and I each did half of everything (except we ran the 400m together). He was an older guy, pushing 60, so he
wend slower than I did and I had a good amount of rest. Still, he pushed hard and I went as fast as I could on the exercises, so a good workout.</p>

    <p>Didn&rsquo;t do too much in the way of workouts conditioning. Mostly played ultimate:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 hours at a PoNY tryout. Didn&rsquo;t make the team.</li>
<li>2 days at Mixed Easterns with Metro North. Handled a lot.</li>
<li>1-day round-robin at Lums Pond in DE. Played against AG, AMP, Tyranis and Jug Handle. Also handled a good amount, primarily for the D line.</li>
<li>3 days at Windmill Windup with Cambridge. Played a lot against some good teams. Fairly happy with my play. Got one of the most difficult and awesome
layout Ds of my life.</li>
<li>4 days of beach ultimate at Bar Do Peixe. Definitely more relaxed that the rest of the tourneys, but still a lot of fun and pretty high quality. Played
a total of 11 games, though they were about half an hour each. Played with some awesome women, including probably the best girl in Portugal. Highlights
include my first layout handblock, a hammer handblock, some good D and strong intensity and focus under pressure (sometimes). Also ridiculous partying
every single night, especially Saturday and Sunday.</li>
</ul>


<p>Today, a return to real workouts. Threw with Miriam at Wooster Square for over an hour. Worked on torso torque on my flicks, spin on my leftie backhands, and flight path on my hammers.</p>

    <h2>Sri Lanka</h2>

<p>Two days of low-level pickup. Sri Lanka doesn&rsquo;t have much of an ultimate
scene, but a few players are trying to get it off the ground. They run
pickup several times a week in Colombo, and occasionally travel to other
cities to play. A few of the players have been to tournaments outside the
country (Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia) but most are casual players.</p>

<p>The pickup itself was fun. The weather was really hot and humid. I didn&rsquo;t
have cleats, so I played in my barefoot shoes. There wasn&rsquo;t much stacking
or force-holding, but everyone knew the rules and played with a lot of
spirit and competitiveness.</p>

<h2>Malaysia</h2>

<p>Diana and I picked up with teams for a day of ultimate at the Grizzly Open.
Diana played with the local powerhouse Care Bears. I played with (and even
captained) a team of pickup players from the area. We both had a lot of fun
playing and teaching. Diana even won the tourney in a very close game.</p>

    <p>Three days of ultimate, partying and foolishness. We played mostly ok, considering the shitty weather, non-seriousness, and future
water consumption. Our ladies (esp Sachie, Hanna, Raha) were consistently great. The rest of us had our moments of greatness and
bogusness, but overall it was a glorious time. We lost in the semis of the middle bracket, played 8 games on the weekend, and sang
&ldquo;Everything is Drinking&rdquo; at least 50 times. Max also got birthdayed at the sushi place and Markham won the party.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played Delaware in the WL chumpionship. Our team played quite well overall, and I finally had a game where I&rsquo;m happy with pretty much everything I did. I
subbed fast, I only threw one turnover, and I was fairly effective on O and D. I even threw Diana a huck for a goal and intentionally macked a hammer to
Furf for a goal (against the rules, I know, but it was awesome). I&rsquo;d say the biggest difference between that game and our semis game was the feeling of
relaxation. I did not feel pressure, I did not rush my throws or decisions, everything was more relaxed and smoother. I don&rsquo;t know how much of that is
because we weren&rsquo;t in contention to win the league, how much was because of skill differences (Del was not bad, but they play a slower college style), how
much was something else. I will meditate on this some more.</p>

    <p>Played Bill&rsquo;s Team (Rag Tag) in the semis. Lost by one point (just like the first time we played them) but the game went a bit differently. This time, we
were down most of the way and went on a 6-point run at the end to bring it within 1. We were missing Furf, Raha and Diana. The game was a lot of fun.
Butter instructed me to win with my legs, and I did that fairly well (perhaps too well - I didn&rsquo;t sub enough and got caught tired at moments). Ben&rsquo;s
fitness seems to have helped, but I stil had some bad throwaways. Billy and Sachie played especially well, and Truskin was unstoppable in the air. I threw
the last throw - a blade to Tom in the endzone - that Owen D'ed very nicely to prevent us from going into overtime.</p>
