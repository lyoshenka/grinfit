    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Overhead Squats, building to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">75</span>lb </span></li>
<li>8/side Dead Bugs</li>
</ul>


<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time (9:00 cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>12-9-6-9-12 Overhead Squats</li>
<li>30 Bicycle Kicks (15/side) after each set of squats</li>
</ul>


<p>I just used a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">45</span>lb </span> bar for the squats, but probably should have gone heavier. I went of my calculated 1RM on the squats, but it was
probably somewhat old and I&rsquo;ve gotten stronger since then.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<h3>Support Holds On Box (5 x 30sec)</h3>

<p>Arms fully locked out, pits of elbows forward, shoulder blades pulled back and down.  Keep torso upright, stay tight. Rest 30 seconds
between efforts.</p>

<h3>Push Ups (4 x 8)</h3>

<p>2 second hold at top (hollow position) and at the bottom.  Rest 30 seconds between sets</p>

<h3>Arch Hold With PVC (4 sets for max time)</h3>

<p>Rest as needed between efforts.</p>

<h3>Box Dips (Foot Assisted) (3 x 10)</h3>

<p>Use feet to help with the movement so as not to overload the shoulder.  Elbows stay tight to body, chest upright, tight core.  Rest 30
seconds between sets.</p>

<h3>Squat Holds (5 x 30-60sec hold)</h3>

<p>This is an active hold, not a stretch.  Perform an air squat and hold the bottom. Fight for upright torso position.  Rest as long as you
were able to hold.</p>

    <h2>Strength</h2>

<p>6 rounds of Snatch Complex. Start a round every 90 seconds. One round is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lift Off</li>
<li>Snatch Pull</li>
<li>Snatch High Pull</li>
<li>Power Snatch</li>
</ul>


<p>I started with 65lb and went up to 75lb halfway through. The goal was to focus on form, not get a high weight. I still have trouble with the
bar following the correct path on the way up (not hitting my knees, touching my thighs).</p>

<h2>Abs</h2>

<p>Tabata Abs. Two rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>AbMat Sit-ups</li>
<li>Tuck Ups</li>
<li>Russian Twists @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>lb </span></li>
<li>Bicycle Kicks</li>
</ul>


<p>My numbers were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">16</span>,<span class="number">16</span>,<span class="number">26</span>,<span class="number">38</span>,<span class="number">13</span>,<span class="number">13</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">20</span> </span> for a total of <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">162</span> reps </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 Total DB Snatches @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">40</span>lb </span></li>
<li>6cals on the assault bike (subbed for 8 10m Line Touches)</li>
<li>8 Slam Balls @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span></li>
<li>max reps Russian Twists w/ Slam Ball</li>
</ul>


<p>You have 1:30 to do each round. Your score is the number of Russian Twists you get through. Rest 1:30 between rounds.</p>

<p>I started with a 35lb DB, but went up to 40lb after the first round because I got a lot of twists in. My numbers were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">27</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">0</span> </span>.
The bike on the last round really killed me. I biked super slow and used up all my time. I just finished the slam balls as time expired.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<p>I missed two weeks of the gymnastics program, so I&rsquo;m doing week 2&rsquo;s workouts now. I didn&rsquo;t do everything because I was tired, but I got in</p>

<ul>
<li>3x6 Slow Pushups (3 seconds down, 3 seconds up)</li>
<li>3x10 Squats with Feet Together</li>
<li>4x20sec Forward Leaning Hold</li>
</ul>

<li>Butterfly Pullup work. I&rsquo;m basically there, just need to get the tempo and leg movement down so I can do them repeatedly without swinging
wildly.</li>
</ul>


<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 Rounds For Time (17min Cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>20 Pullups</li>
<li>20 Goblet Squats @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">30</span>lb </span></li>
<li>10cal Assault Bike (subbed for 40 double-unders)</li>
</ul>


<p>I did kipping pullups for the first two rounds, but completely tore up my hands in the process. So I switched to SVPUs for the last two
rounds. I finished the workout in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">13</span>:<span class="number">59</span> </span></p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<ul>
<li>3x8 Supine-grip Ring Rows: Slow pull (no snaking or jerking) with a 2 second hold at the top. Rest 60 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>5x60sec Bottom-of-Squat Hold: Rest as long as you were able to hold. Fight for upright torso position.</li>
<li>5x Chin-over-bar Hold for max time: Stay hollow at the top, use a band only if absolutely necessary. Rest as needed between efforts.</li>
<li>4x10 per side One-Legged Box Squats: No rest, just switch sides.</li>
<li>4x30-60sec Plank on Elbows</li>
</ul>


<p>The gymnastics work was pretty brutal today because it was almost exactly the same thing we did during the WOD. I couldn&rsquo;t even do the
chin-over-bar hangs because my hands were dead. The ring rows were really hard as well. The rest of the workout was decent. I killed squat
holds and did fairly well on box squats (though I didn&rsquo;t know the focus was on going slow and balancing). I hit 45sec on each plank.</p>

    <h2>Strength</h2>

<p>20:00min of Clean and Jerk. Build up to a heavy single.</p>

<p>I topped out at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">185</span>lb </span>, which basically ties my PR. I hit the clean on 190, but missed the jerk (twice). Again, same as last time.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>10-8-6-4-2 reps of</p>

<ul>
<li>Power Clean &amp; Jerk @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">115</span>lb </span></li>
<li>Knees to Elbows</li>
</ul>


<p>I finished in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">9</span>:<span class="number">13</span> </span>, just shy of the 10min cap.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<ul>
<li>3x5 Push-ups: 3sec descent and a 5sec hollow hold at the top, actively pushing into the ground. Rest 60 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>3x8 Wall Squats: slow, controlled descent; 2 second hold at bottom. Fight for good position. Rest 60 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>5x30sec Support Holds. Arms fully locked out, pits of elbows forward, shoulder blades pulled back and down. Keep torso upright, stay
tight. Rest 30 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>4x Arch Holds for max time. Rest as needed between efforts.</li>
<li>2-4min Hollow Hold (break up into multiple sets as needed).</li>
</ul>


<p>Today was the first day of the 6-week gymnastic basics program. It&rsquo;s a lot of core work and static holds, with a focus on form and quality
reps. It was all bodyweight stuff, but some of the movements were quite challenging. The wall squats really hit my shoulders hard. The
hollow hold also killed me. I did 40 seconds for my first set, then dropped to 15 and even 10 seconds for the next few sets. I just barely
made it past 2 min before giving up.</p>
