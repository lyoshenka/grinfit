    <p>Sectionals is always a bit of a weak tournament, but our lack of preparation helped make things interesting. Saturday was mostly a walk in the park, though we managed to let the 2 seed in our pool give us a close game. Sunday, we went up 12-8 against Muff'n Men but then lost our shit and gave up 5 quick, easy goals in a row to let them win on universe. Dropping into the 2nd-place bracket, we beat Jagged Ice handily but played down to Jug Handle and had to score on D on universe point to win the game (which we did). That took us to a rematch against Muff'n Men (who lost 14-6 to Amp in the 1st place game). They seemed more tired and we didn&rsquo;t make the same rusty party-till-4am mistakes. We went up early and won the game 12-9.</p>

<p>Despite our rough weekend, I&rsquo;m still optimistic. We got in a lot of valuable practice time and showed that our D can be strong when we need it to be. Our O still struggles, but that should improve with more practice and less drinking. Personally, I thought I played well on D (except one terrible attempt at poaching the lane). My O performance was variable. Mostly I played well and even put up some big throws, but sometimes those big throws were ill-advised and downright crappy. Also, the wind kicked my ass on a few throws where the disc either popped up when the wind caught the bottom of it, or dropped because I babied it too much and didn&rsquo;t put enough spin on it.</p>
