    <p>Pretty good day. First up, we played Freaks - the Japanese team. They are all very fast and athletic and they play a different style of ultimate that I&rsquo;m used to. Instead of cuts coming primarily from the stack and toward the handlers, their first look is either to an upline handler cut or to a short cut from the front of the stack and then a leading dishie to a handler. It&rsquo;s very interesting - their momentum is always toward the endzone they are attacking and almost never away from it. This lets them always see the field and sets them up for great flow. However, no one on their team was over 6 feet tall and that really limits their deep game. They tried to throw it deep past us a few times but it rarely worked. That let us focus on taking away their short game and really limited their options. On O, we took advantage of the height mismatches and their need to back us and double/triple team us on deep cuts. I think we were up the whole game and ended up winning by 2.</p>

<p>Game 2, we played Ono. They had a bunch of ex-Condors and mostly older guys, but they were very tall and had great throws. Freaks beat Ono in the morning, but we couldn&rsquo;t do the same. We also dropped the disc 7 or 8 times for no reason at all. Not a very good game for us.</p>

<p>In pre-quarters, we played the Stanford undergrads. They had a few talented players but they couldn&rsquo;t really match up to us. The game actually ended up being a lot closer than it should have been when they made a late-game run for a few points. But the game got capped and we won 13-12.</p>

    <p>We started the tourney off with a quick loss ot UCSC Slugs Alum. I don&rsquo;t know how many of those guys actually went to UCSC, but they had some strong players from Sockeye, Chain, Subzero and some other teams. Their deep shots were money and we didn&rsquo;t play very well. Next, we beat the other two teams in our pool: Bag of Wine (the eventual spirit winner, made us 6-way funnel half a bag of wine) and Spurburry Makai (the NYC guys, only had 12 people and didn&rsquo;t play well). We also played tons of Spikeball between games. Summerspike - watch out.</p>

    <p>Kayaked for two hours on the Hanalei river. We woke up early to get some kayaking in before our flight from Kauai to Oahu. We were the first ones out there, so there wasn&rsquo;t much traffic. But we did see several 6-person outrigger canoe teams cruise by us. I had never really been taught how to kayak, so Bill gave me some good tips. To summarize: sit up, paddle smoothly and not to close to the kayak, look at the front tip for better steering feedback.</p>

    <p>Did a day hike to the <a href="http://www.everytrail.com/guide/hanakapi-ai-falls-na-pali-coast-kauai">Hanakapi'ai Falls</a> along the Na Pali Coast trail. The hike is 8 miles round trip and very muddy and up-and-down, but the view is awesome the whole time. The first two miles are along the coast. You can see the ocean, the forest, the hills and you even get to see whales sometimes (we saw one spouting water). Then you get to a small beach and head inland for another two miles of almost-rainforst. The waterfall itself is very narrow but extremely tall (300ft). Eug, Tim, Krista and I jumped in and swam under the fall to hang out on the other side. The water was quite cold but very refreshing.</p>

    <p>Did about 40 ab rollouts while watching the Superbowl. My first one was from my toes but with a pillow. The rest were from my knees. I did most of them pretty slowly, usually waiting a second or two at the bottom before coming up. Towards the end I started doing them to the sides, but it&rsquo;s pretty awkward.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Leiout was awesome again this year. The weather was beautiful (70 and sunny each day), our team was fun and we played 8 awesome games of beach ultimate.</p>

<h2>Friday Night</h2>

<p>Met the team. It was mostly the same team as last year. For guys, we traded Jon and a few west coast pickups for DanD, Jay Walker and Bill (Steve&rsquo;s friend from Albaquerque). For girls, only Catie remained from last year. We picked up KayKay, Kelsey, Val, Jill and Holly. We all pregamed at the hotel (played Val&rsquo;s Deck game), then partied at Rustys. I was reminded just how many players from New York come to Leiout. I think it&rsquo;s because they can&rsquo;t wait for Wildwood and need a beach ultimate fix.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>We played pretty well most of the time, but ended up going 1-3. We lost at least one (maybe two) games where we were up at the end but relaxed too much and didn&rsquo;t finish strong. My throws were much better this year than last year, especially the hucks. I don&rsquo;t know what I changed, but I figured out how to throw floaty hucks out to space in front of receivers without throwing them out the back of the endzone. I still had some throwaways and stupid mistakes, but I felt pretty good overall. Max also played outstandingly. He made several very athletic grabs and skys. Turns out he&rsquo;s actually pretty good when he&rsquo;s not drunk.</p>

<h2>Sat Night</h2>

<p>Thai for dinner, more Deck, then tournament party. Compared to last year, this one was pretty lame. It had a lot of potential but they didn&rsquo;t do anything with it. The space was a large warehouse (reminds me of raves I went to in high school) with several tables/bars and one dancing crowd in front of the speakers. There was no place to sit, no games to play and no free drinks ($7 for a whiskey sour is kind of a lot). After we got bored, we went to Barnie&rsquo;s Beanery and played shufflepuck.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>We dropped down to become the 5 seed in a lower pool (I think it was F pool). We resolved to come out strong and maintain our focus, and that paid off. We won our first two games pretty easily and were up in the third, but hit a speed bump. The other team went up and had the disc in the endzone to win it, but their cutter dropped a wide-open throw for the goal. We scored, then broke them twice more for the win. It was extremely lucky, but we&rsquo;ll take it.</p>

<p>In the finals, we played a UCLA alum team. The game was close the whole time. We started up a point and took turns scoring and trading breaks. I think they were up after half but we broke them to go up one. Towards the end, we up 9-8 when Steve got a minor concussion. We scored the point to get to universe for us, but then our luck changed. They scored and we put on our universe line to end the game. We worked the disc very well, moving side to side and making steady progress up the field. We were about 10 feet from the endzone and just needed an easy goal, but Steve threw it sideways across the field and out of bounds. UCLA came back to score, then broke us twice more to seal the deal.</p>

<h2>Sun Night</h2>

<p>Lots of gyros, dinner at the Beanery, Deck, a late attempt at Rustys, Ale House, late night food search, Fuck the Dealer, more Deck.</p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<ol>
<li>Eating is super important. I felt way better after eating that fruit before finals.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t let anyone play if they have a concussion, even if its minor. They will make mistakes.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/from-soup-to-nuts/105732239">From Soup To Nuts</a>: a nice 5.7 crack with a tricky start but then smooth sailing after that. I spent most of the time halfway in the crack, halfway on the face.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/abbey-road/105733046">Abbey Road</a>: My onsight lead, a pretty easy 5.4. It was probably too easy of a climb, but I&rsquo;m not good at leading so it was fun to practice. Plus it set us up for our next climb, which I considered leading but chickened out because it looked tough and not well protected at the start.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/fleet-street/105732299">Fleet Street</a>: A tricky 5.8R face climb. Steve and Jeremy went before me so I got some beta on how to do the start (gotta smear and mantle), so that made it easier. If I hadn&rsquo;t seen them do it, I think I would have had a much tougher time. Either way, I really liked it. It was different from the cracks we climbed before and I felt much sketchier without the clear footholds.</li>

    <p>Steve, Eddie and I climbed two routes at Calico Basin (near Las Vegas). Eddie led both routes, then Steve climbed, then I climbed and cleaned up. First, we climbed <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/singing-love-pen/105733040">Singing Love Pen</a>. It&rsquo;s a 5.9 and the crux is pretty tough. I got through it eventually, but not without a bit of hanging on the rope. The second route was <a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/North_America/United_States/Nevada/Red_Rock_Canyon/Calico_Basin/Moderate_Mecca/Valentine_s_Day_27439.html">Valentine&rsquo;s Day</a>, a fun 5.8 crack climb. It was tricky at parts, with one section that&rsquo;s very low on footholds, but I managed to send it on my first try. Steve also sent it, making it his first outdoor ascent.</p>
