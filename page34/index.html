    <p>Had a solid workout at Penn Park. We opened with burpee broad jumps, then moved on to several lateral cutting drills. First was a simple lateral shuffle drill, switching sides on command. Next, we did a the short-cut-long-cut drill where defense reacts to the offense. Finally, we did the O-vs-D cutting in a box drill. After the lateral movements, we finished with several sprints of increasing length.</p>

<p>After the workout, we had an AMP dinner and leadership meeting at City Tap.</p>

    <p>Henlopen, the first tournament of the season. Almost everyone on the team was from amp2012 . We played well on D but were not consistent on O. Sometimes we looked good and worked the disc well, but sometimes we would stagnate and have trouble moving the disc off the sideline. I threw a ton of same-third throws that should have been fakes-and-swings instead.</p>

<p>Things to work on: footwork, avoiding low-percentage throws.</p>

<p>New rule: every time I throw an ill-advised huck, I get slapped in the face.</p>

<p>Experiment/drill: sharp-angle cuts vs wide-angle cuts.</p>

    <p>Back-to-back penn park workouts. Here&rsquo;s what we did tonight:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 sets of suicide cuts. First set was alternating backhands and forehands, seconds set was all backhands, last set was all flicks.</li>
<li>3 sets of triangle cut drill.</li>
<li>Go-to drill, but each throw was intentionally high. The goal is to throw it <em>almost</em> out of reach of the cutter. The cutter&rsquo;s goal is to catch the disc by translating their forward momentum into a jump - the less slowing down, the better.</li>
<li>Agility ladder with an in-cut at the end.</li>

    <h2>Part 1 - Sprints</h2>

<p>10 30-yard sprints with different variations. Walk back after each sprint.</p>

<ol>
<li>Hit your top speed at the end of the sprint</li>
<li>Hit your top speed 75% of the way into the sprint</li>
<li>Hit yoru top speed halfway into the sprint</li>

<li>Backpedal 10, sprint 30</li>
<li>Backpedal 10, sprint 30</li>
</ol>


<h2>Part 2 - Plyos</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pair up. 3 rouds of: 10 medball throws straight up for height with a 15lb medball (alternate with your partner), 10 sideways hurdle jumps over your partner.</li>
<li>10 reps of: sprint 15, jump as high as you can when you hit the 15yd line. We did the first few to the line and the rest to a cue (either a whistle or when we saw a stationary person jump).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Part 3 - Hunger Drill</h2>

<p>It was pretty windy but we got in some solid throwing and cutting. It was really hard to read, so I focused on getting in front of the other player and boxing out hard, even if I ended up misreading the disc somewhat.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played two days of indoor at the Indoor Nationals. The whole thing was not very well organized and the fields were crappy (they were square) but it was still fun to play. We played well on Saturday but lost by 1 to a not-very-strong team. We still ended up winning our pool on point diff. Sunday, we beat Boston (the eventual winner) and made it as far as semis, but then lost in the semis to a team from DC. Our defense was good throughout the weekend, but our offense was disorganized at times and gave up too many turns. I&rsquo;m not really sure what the cause was - square fields, lack of playing together, strong opponents? Either way, there&rsquo;s more to work on for the future.</p>

<p>After playing 4 games on Sat and 4 on Sunday, I went to our first indoor spring league games Sunday night. We won both and played pretty well, but again took too many ill-advised throws on offense. But I&rsquo;m excited for spring league. Our team is fun and solid, and the seasson (which is 1/3rd over) promises to be a fun one.</p>

    <p>Group workout at Penn Park. Did a bunch of plyos and agility work. Here&rsquo;s what I remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 sets of 4 reps of: jog 10, sprint 10, walk 10. 30 seconds rest between sets.</li>
<li>3 sets of 8 depth jumps. Focus on exploding up and spending as little time on the ground as possible.</li>
<li>3 sets of 10 side-to-side hurdle jumps. Same emphasis.</li>
<li>3 sets of O vs D in-out cut sprints. Start on the middle cone, sprint to either the left or the right cone, then sprint to the opposite cone. D starts as soon as O moves, so O gets a small head start.</li>
<li>4 sets of 10 jumps for height. First and last set were off both legs, 2nd and 3rd set were 5 off one leg then 5 off the other.</li>
<li>4 sets of single-leg hops for distance. We hopped about 30 yards in one direction, then hopped on the opposite leg coming back.</li>
<li>4 tabata rounds of: U-jumps, mountain climbers, V jumps, broad jump and backpedal</li>
<li>a few agility ladder sets with Void</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Fools was a blast, as usual. I spent most of my time playing and partying with ShortFatGuys (mostly DoG players + Wiggins and Idaho + some younger guys from NYC and Rochester + DanD, Dana and myself), but I picked up with Penn and the GodFeathers for a few games. I think I played 11 games over 3 days. Most were foolish, but several were really intense - we had two games against Plonkers (aka Ring) and one against UVA alums (Truck Stop) that we managed to win.</p>

<p>Takeaways from the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>I cut too close to the handlers. Need to clear earlier.</li>
<li>I have to stop clearing up the sideline and clear to the front of the stack.</li>
<li>When chasing a deep cut on D, spend less time looking for the disc and more time chasing. Otherwise I won&rsquo;t catch up.</li>
<li>My backhand dumps suck. Need to step out and reach farther.</li>
<li>Zone defense: commit early. Don&rsquo;t get stuck between two players, pick one and go.</li>
<li><strong>Team defense</strong>. We don&rsquo;t play enough of that in Philly.</li>
</ul>

<p>After that, we played our 3rd place game against Butter&rsquo;s full team. His full team was also missing a lot of players, so most of them were pickups and the whole game felt like a high-level pickup game (I spent a quarter playing tag with Marin instead of playing the game). We ended up winning by a lot.</p>

    <p>Played Bill&rsquo;s team (SHREK). We won by a good amount. We only had 5 guys, but I think that worked well for us.</p>

    <p>Venose talked me into going to a Hammerheads practice. It wasn&rsquo;t terrible, but it was definitely a waste of time for me. We scrimmaged a lot, which was nice, but I don&rsquo;t see myself playing for them, not even occasionally.</p>

<p>After that, Keg dropped me off at Tee&rsquo;s for my winter league game. We were short on players (5 guys, 3 girls) but we pulled off a solid win against Venose&rsquo;s team.</p>

<p>Mega ultimate weekend over.</p>

    <p>First, played an hour of indoor with AMP. I tried out my abbreviated warmups and I think they went well. I just need to speak louder and demonstrate the new exercises up front.</p>

<p>After that, we drove over to MapleZone and played in the first-ever Indoor Regionals. We won our first and third poold game easily but lost the second one to Tad&rsquo;s team. We still made semis though. In semis, we beat Scorpio (BLo&rsquo;s team and probably the favorite to win it). Then in the finals, we had a rematch against Tad&rsquo;s team and beat them by 2 points to win the whole thing. Tad&rsquo;s team ended up beating BLo in the backdoor finals to take the second bid to nationals.</p>
