    <p>Had a double-length practice today. We had over 40 people there. Did a bunch of drills for marking (esp straight-up) and breaking the mark. We also worked on a sequence for getting the disk off the sideline. We scrimmaged for about 3 hours total, which was awesome. After practice, we went to Percy Street BBQ for some delicious brisket and beer.</p>

    <p>Went to a Spinners practice. We started with a few force-middle dump drills, then spent the rest of practice scrimmageing. We played a 3-team game to 7 (final scores: 7-6-6) and then worked on breaking up the pull play and double-team sideline traps. Overall, very beneficial.</p>

We also played some 7 on 7 at the end, and then conditioned with 3 Jamals and 9 20m sprints.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A day full of ultimate. In the morning, Justin and I played a hat tourney at Edgely. Team &ldquo;Favorite Nonalcoholic Beverage&rdquo; played three games. The first two were close but not that serious (we won the first, lost the second). The last game was against Dre and Billy&rsquo;s team, which got me really fired up to win. We didn&rsquo;t play well at first, but went on a strong 5-point run to take half. We held our lead through the second half (though they narrowed the gap) but gave up two breaks on universe point to lose the game. Most of our team was pretty young, but we also had a few more experienced players. It was a great mix and we had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>After the games, Justin, Maddie and I hit up Chipotle and then swung by Sedgely for a bit of disc golf. We met Panna and Billy at hole 3 and played till the 9th hole. Then Anna picked me up and we headed off to indoor spring league.</p>

<p>We had a double header against Dre&rsquo;s team and then Butter&rsquo;s team. The first game was close for the whole game, but in the 4th quarter we made a concerted effort to move the disc quickly and not try to huck it, which helped us score a few quick breaks in a row and win the game 37-31. The second game was tougher, with us trailing by 1 for most of the game. We took the lead sometimes, but we were pretty tired and didn&rsquo;t have enough discipline to pull out the win. They won 31-30, handing us our first loss of the season.</p>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m really sore.</p>

    <p>Last AMP workout of the preseason. We warmed up with some throws, then worked on defense. We did the hunger drill (focusing on boxing out) and then the defensive positioning drill (focusing on bodying up while remaining balanced). Then we moved on to a 3 on 3 flow drill, where two cutters and a thrower (plus defenders) had to complete three passes on a full field (focus on defending in space, disc movement, setting up continuation cuts). Finally, we played several 4 on 4 games on a full field (focus on disc movement, smart decisions). We finished with a bit of sprints and ab conditioning.</p>

Next, we did a the short-cut-long-cut drill where defense reacts to the offense. Finally, we did the O-vs-D cutting in a box drill. After the lateral movements, we finished with several sprints of increasing length.</p>

<p>After the workout, we had an AMP dinner and leadership meeting at City Tap.</p>

    <p>Henlopen, the first tournament of the season. Almost everyone on the team was from amp2012 . We played well on D but were not consistent on O. Sometimes we looked good and worked the disc well, but sometimes we would stagnate and have trouble moving the disc off the sideline. I threw a ton of same-third throws that should have been fakes-and-swings instead.</p>

<p>Things to work on: footwork, avoiding low-percentage throws.</p>

<p>New rule: every time I throw an ill-advised huck, I get slapped in the face.</p>

<li>3 sets of suicide cuts. First set was alternating backhands and forehands, seconds set was all backhands, last set was all flicks.</li>
<li>3 sets of triangle cut drill.</li>
<li>Go-to drill, but each throw was intentionally high. The goal is to throw it <em>almost</em> out of reach of the cutter. The cutter&rsquo;s goal is to catch the disc by translating their forward momentum into a jump - the less slowing down, the better.</li>
<li>Agility ladder with an in-cut at the end.</li>

<h2>Part 2 - Plyos</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pair up. 3 rouds of: 10 medball throws straight up for height with a 15lb medball (alternate with your partner), 10 sideways hurdle jumps over your partner.</li>
<li>10 reps of: sprint 15, jump as high as you can when you hit the 15yd line. We did the first few to the line and the rest to a cue (either a whistle or when we saw a stationary person jump).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Part 3 - Hunger Drill</h2>

<p>It was pretty windy but we got in some solid throwing and cutting. It was really hard to read, so I focused on getting in front of the other player and boxing out hard, even if I ended up misreading the disc somewhat.</p>

    <p>Played two days of indoor at the Indoor Nationals. The whole thing was not very well organized and the fields were crappy (they were square) but it was still fun to play. We played well on Saturday but lost by 1 to a not-very-strong team. We still ended up winning our pool on point diff. Sunday, we beat Boston (the eventual winner) and made it as far as semis, but then lost in the semis to a team from DC. Our defense was good throughout the weekend, but our offense was disorganized at times and gave up too many turns. I&rsquo;m not really sure what the cause was - square fields, lack of playing together, strong opponents? Either way, there&rsquo;s more to work on for the future.</p>

<p>After playing 4 games on Sat and 4 on Sunday, I went to our first indoor spring league games Sunday night. We won both and played pretty well, but again took too many ill-advised throws on offense. But I&rsquo;m excited for spring league. Our team is fun and solid, and the seasson (which is 1/3rd over) promises to be a fun one.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Group workout at Penn Park. Did a bunch of plyos and agility work. Here&rsquo;s what I remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 sets of 4 reps of: jog 10, sprint 10, walk 10. 30 seconds rest between sets.</li>
<li>3 sets of 8 depth jumps. Focus on exploding up and spending as little time on the ground as possible.</li>
<li>3 sets of 10 side-to-side hurdle jumps. Same emphasis.</li>
<li>3 sets of O vs D in-out cut sprints. Start on the middle cone, sprint to either the left or the right cone, then sprint to the opposite cone. D starts as soon as O moves, so O gets a small head start.</li>
<li>4 sets of 10 jumps for height. First and last set were off both legs, 2nd and 3rd set were 5 off one leg then 5 off the other.</li>
<li>4 sets of single-leg hops for distance. We hopped about 30 yards in one direction, then hopped on the opposite leg coming back.</li>
<li>4 tabata rounds of: U-jumps, mountain climbers, V jumps, broad jump and backpedal</li>
<li>a few agility ladder sets with Void</li>
</ul>


<p>All this was followed by supper club at La Petit Creperie.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Fools was a blast, as usual. I spent most of my time playing and partying with ShortFatGuys (mostly DoG players + Wiggins and Idaho + some younger guys from NYC and Rochester + DanD, Dana and myself), but I picked up with Penn and the GodFeathers for a few games. I think I played 11 games over 3 days. Most were foolish, but several were really intense - we had two games against Plonkers (aka Ring) and one against UVA alums (Truck Stop) that we managed to win.</p>

<p>Takeaways from the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>I cut too close to the handlers. Need to clear earlier.</li>
<li>I have to stop clearing up the sideline and clear to the front of the stack.</li>
<li>When chasing a deep cut on D, spend less time looking for the disc and more time chasing. Otherwise I won&rsquo;t catch up.</li>
<li>My backhand dumps suck. Need to step out and reach farther.</li>
<li>Zone defense: commit early. Don&rsquo;t get stuck between two players, pick one and go.</li>
<li><strong>Team defense</strong>. We don&rsquo;t play enough of that in Philly.</li>
</ul>
