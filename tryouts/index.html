    <p>Two days of 4-hour tryouts. The plan for each day was lots of scrimmaging, a few drills, and a bit of conditioning at the end. I felt pretty
good, though could have been in better shape. My pulls were kinda weak, but I did take some time to work on my flicks. I also did pretty
well in the conditioning, but I think I def need to work on fitness. Lifting is good, but I gotta get shuttles/shuffles in, and more metcon
work as well.</p>

    <p>Went to the first weekend of Metro tryouts. I didn&rsquo;t play much, because I&rsquo;m still rehabbing my knee. But I did warmups, participated in a
few drills, and spent a lot of time stretching and slow-squatting. I also helped out where I could, collecting discs and dispensing advice.
Tryouts went well - there are some promising new players, old vets, and friends who I haven&rsquo;t played with in a while. Best of all, my knee
feels pretty good. I didn&rsquo;t do much, but its the first workout I&rsquo;ve done in a while that didn&rsquo;t leave my tendon sore.</p>

<p>On the downside, I&rsquo;m months behind in fitness. I&rsquo;ll have to work hard over the next few months to catch up, but be careful not to overdo it.
I&rsquo;m really looking forward to having a squat rack in my basement.</p>

    <p>Tryouts went 3-6pm Saturday and then 9am-noon on Sunday. The format was mostly this: warm up, a bit of cutting/throwing drills, 3v3 mini,
4v4 full-field, 7v7 full-field. I had a lot of fun both days, playing against good players and being outside. The weather was a bit cold and
rainy today, but it really was not a problem.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel a bit more tired that I should (and felt somewhat more tired throughout the weekend then I think I should). I&rsquo;m chalking
it up to early-seasonness, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt this way in previous seasons (even last season, when I took 5 weeks off in
April-May). However, my flick hucks were pretty good for most of the weekend (only had one mistake), my breaks were solid, and my D was good
for the most part. I had a lot of trouble with Korber and Match, but did a good job on just about everyone else. My main problem was my
backhand hucks (I&rsquo;m 0-for-2) and timidness in the air (got skied a few times when I shouldn&rsquo;t have). My I/O flick was also a bit shitty at
times during mini, but that&rsquo;s probably due to fatigue for the most part.</p>

    <p>Tried out for spinners, along with about 40 others (returners and rookies). Played as a handler, threw some saucy throws and got some Ds, but also botched
a few plays. I&rsquo;d be surprised if I get cut now, but I&rsquo;m definitely not on the team yet.</p>

    <p>Great practice with AMP. I was a bit hurt so I didn&rsquo;t go 100% on everything, but I still played a decent amount. We worked on defense for the most part: deep D, under D, etc. There was a good amount of scrimmaging, which is always nice, and the drills were pretty fun and felt useful. Also my throwing on Friday definitely paid off because my throws were pretty good today (except when they were catastrophically bad). Especially in the away cut drill, my flicks finally had enough IO on them to stay straight in the wind. Unfortunately, it did not translate well to in-game hucks. I did have a really nice full-field huck to Diana, but it was just a bit too far :-(</p>

    <p>Another amp tryout, another injury. I think I strained my quad during warmups or the first drill or something. It feels very much like the time I messed up my right quad at OMK. But this time I&rsquo;m gonna take good care of it and not come back until I&rsquo;m ready. So I spent most of the practice watching the drills and the grames.</p>

<p>20 seconds ice-cold shower.</p>

    <p>Amp&rsquo;s first tournament of the season. I&rsquo;m still coming back from my tendonitis, so I only played half a day on Saturday. The weekend was a mix of ups and downs for me. I started off on a huge down, with two drops and three turns in our first game (which we ended up losing). The rest of the games went pretty well. We beat AG on Saturday, then won our quarters game on Sunday and lost a very close game to AG in semis. I caught a layout Callahan against AG.</p>

<p>Things I need to improve: cutting on O. My awareness is decent but needs work, especially paying attention to my teammates. I also need to learn to stop and cut faster and to throw better into the wind. Finally, fewer turns. Maybe it was just my first game outside, but the throwaways were poor decisions and that&rsquo;s no good.</p>

<p>EDIT: also got bit by a tick sometime this weekend. This might come in handy later.</p>

    <p>Did our first structured tryout. We did several drills (give-n-go, breakside cuts, 3 on 3 for 3, 3 on 3 for 2 turns) and then went to a full 7 on 7 scrimmage. It was a bit windy and I threw some bad throwaways. I&rsquo;m also out of shape after not running for a few weeks. But it will come back to me.</p>

    <p>3 hours of Phoenix tryouts at Maple Zone. We spent most of the time doing drills. The first few drills were pretty cool - 4 stations, each with a different set of cuts, and you run the cuts as fast as you can. There was a straight 40, a 10yard incut followed by a 40 deep, and two drills with 2 short cuts each. We ran each set of cuts once and were timed.</p>

<p>After the cuts, we had 4 more stations to rotate through:</p>

<ul>
<li>baseball drill</li>
<li>defense drill (defending an incut, break cut and deep cut, then later defending the dump)</li>
<li>breakmark drill, then continuation cutting drill</li>
<li>marking drill</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally at the end we got to scrimmage two games to 7. I wish we had played more, but it was still fun.</p>
