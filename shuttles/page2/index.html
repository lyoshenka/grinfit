<li>Warmup plyos</li>

    <p>Ran 6 150m shuttles with Butter and Sara. First 3 were a 50m course, last 3 were 25m course. I ran the 50m ones in about 24-25s each. The 25m ones were
27-28s each. We also warmed up by jogging the circumference of the field twice. We did long strides for the long edges and slow jog for the short edges.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Sara and I joined the Penn pickup crew and played ultimate for a while. She left early, I stuck around till the end. There were a few new
girls there. Two were high schoolers and one just moved to the area. One of the high schoolers had a cannon flick for her age, and the other was a good
deep cutter and receiver. Pretty sure Butter&rsquo;s recruiting them for his indoor team.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;d taken the whole week off before last practice, and took Monday off as well to make sure my knee was 100%. But I couldn&rsquo;t keep doing nothing, so I came
out for the last workout to do some shuttles, shuffles and throwing. We took forever finding a place to run because most fields were busy with intramurals
or other team practice. Eventually we ran 4 shuttles and 4 shuffles, then threw till the IM ultimate game kicked us off.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>We threw between most of the shuttles. Then after we were done, we worked on throwing a dishy and cutting deep for the huck. We did that a few times with and into the wind, but only caught about half the hucks. The rest were either overthrown (with the wind) or just bad throws. After cutting for hucks, we just worked on our deep throws. My backhands are decent but my flicks are still awful.</p>

<p>I threw between most of the shuttles. Then Diana and I went to Left Bank and threw medium-distance for 10 min or so. I worked on keeping my flicks high and flat, and throwing flicks after a backhand fake.</p>

<p>Threw for about a minute between each shutle.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>Spent about 10 minutes working on my throws. Primarily worked on the full-extension backhand fake to the flick throw. I have trouble getting power when coming all the way back from a full step-out. Watching Melanie throw, I noticed that she doesn&rsquo;t pivot the full 180 degrees on the way back. She goes about 135, with her right foot out in front of her left. That seemed to help, will try it next time. Also, gotta throw the disc more up and IO when reaching far or pivoting hard.</p>

<li>4x150m with 25m cones: about <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">27</span> seconds </span> each</li>

<p>150 seconds rest between each rep. We threw during some of the rests but forgot during others.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>Mel showed up during the end of our shuttles and we threw for about 15 min. I worked on my flick throws - trying to get them smooth, flat and high enough.</p>

<h2>Lateral Shuffles</h2>

<ul>
<li>4x10m shuffles with 15 seconds on, 45 seconds rest</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pickup</h2>

<p>Played half an hour or so of pickup in the park. It was not very high-level but a few good players were there so I got to cover them.</p>

    <p>Second workout of the day. I skipped out on most of the sprints, shuttles and hill sprints because I lifted earlier. Instead I threw with Gabe and Maddie. Then I worked on defensive positioning and threw some more.</p>

<p>For the record, here&rsquo;s the workout:</p>

<h2>20m Sprints</h2>

<p>Do a bunch of 20m sprints with different starts. Start facing different directions, loading one leg or the other, leaning forwards, stepping backwards, etc. My favorite was to set up as if you&rsquo;re covering someone in the stack and have them cut in while you chase. If the defender beats the cutter to the line, they win a prize (in this case, a chicken wing). Rest for full recovery between sprints.</p>

<p>I skipped everything but the O-D sprints.</p>

<h2>Shuttles</h2>

<p>Sprint 50m, do 5 side-to-side shuffles between two cones, sprint 50m, shuffle again, sprint 50m. Not sure what the rest is, I&rsquo;d do 1-2min.</p>

<h2>Hill Sprints</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t see what they did because I was throwing, but I did discover that Penn Park has some nice short hills to sprint up.</p>

<h2>Defense Drill</h2>

<p>Did Nick&rsquo;s box drill several times. Worked on focusing on my defenders hips, staying close to them and being on the correct side of them. Also on my footwork. Papa pointed out that on Amp, we tend to spend a lot of time watching the disc when our person is not active. That&rsquo;s important, but we should be spending more time watching our person and only glancing at the disc momentarily to get an idea of what&rsquo;s going on. This will let us react faster to our person making a move, and we&rsquo;ll be closer on the D.</p>

    <p>Played a close game against a good team tonight. We were up most of the way, starting from the first break, then taking half 8-6, then being up 12-9. But then, they scored 4 in a row and ended up winning 15-13. We played solid D and O for the most part, though we didn&rsquo;t go to the break side as much as I would have liked. Our main problem was our endzone O. When we had the disc on the line, we either struggled to score or failed completely. Jeff noticed it too, so hopefully we&rsquo;ll work on it next game. We also got beat deep too many times, especially by this one girl on their team. Deep D is still a weak point for us, though our girls did a great job running switches and helping clog the lanes and the deep space. That will probably be a plus for us all season (at least when Diana and Katie are there).</p>

<p>After the game, we ran 4 sets of 5x20yd shuttles in the endzone with 60sec rest in between.</p>

<p>8 150yd shuttles (3x50yd) with the following rests: 50,75,90,120,75,90,50</p>

<p>Did them all in 23-24 seconds. Felt kinda slow on the last 20-40 yards of each, and my times are down two seconds from last shuttles workout.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>Then Bulb and I threw for about 20 min. My mid-range throws are coming along nicely but I still have a bad tendency to throw them too low. Need to aim higher, even if it seems weird to me. My deep throws were not great, prolly because I was tired and not very focused. Scoober is coming along nicely - need to not throw so far from my body and need to think about throwing it into a trash can.</p>

    <p>Ran pretty much the same workout as yesterday, with a few extra 150s thrown in. Then threw with Jesse for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Running behind Purifico is demoralizing. He&rsquo;s not even trying and he&rsquo;s kicking my ass on every lap.</p>

<p>Workout:</p>

<ul>
<li>warmup 150m</li>
<li>2 min rest</li>
<li>300m</li>
<li>2 min rest</li>
<li>300m</li>
<li>4 min rest</li>
<li>300m</li>
<li>2 min rest</li>
<li>150m</li>
<li>90 sec rest</li>
<li>300m</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Warmup</h2>

<p>Some jogging, dymanic stretches and agility ladder work. A few accelerators and a tiny bit of footwork efficiency stuff (cutting, following a cutter).</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>Threw with Papa for about 15 mintutes. The MLU discs really fly much straighter and are not as affected by the wind. I&rsquo;m sold.</p>
