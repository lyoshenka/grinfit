The weather was hot, but the location is the best - the fields were\nbeautiful, the ocean was amazing (even at night, and even despite the jellyfish), and the Daquiri Deck was even better than I remember it.\nThe only thing lacking was our game. We lost all our games on Thursday (9-12 Blackbird, 11-12 AMP, 11-12 Toro), then won the next 4 games\nand clawed our way back into the top 8 before losing the 7/8 game to Drag'n Thrust (13-10 Love Tractor, 14-11 Steamboat, 12-11 Blackbird,\n15-9 shame, 9-15 Drag'n). So, no finals appearance this year, but we did win the spirit award, which is almost as big.\n\nPersonally I played fairly well. I was only in 2-4 points a game, so I was fresh overall. I had 3 turns total - a drop against AMP and two\nthrowaways on hucks. Both were good decisions, decently well-thrown, and just a little off the mark. We talked about taking calculated\nrisks, so I stand by them. I scored 5 goals, threw one, and got a D. I felt I could have contributed more, esp filling in as an O line\ncutter when our O was tired (like the last game on Thurs), but we ran a fairly tight rotation so I did my best to help from the sideline.\n\nAnother nationals highlight was watching AMP make it to the finals for the first time ever. They played really well, but ended up losing on\nuniverse to Mixtape in a very exciting game. Despite that, I&rsquo;m really happy for them. Their team is very young and they&rsquo;ll be strong for a\nfew years at least (if they stick together).\n\nFinally, the best part (as always) is spending time with people you know and like. I had a great time bonding with the team (chai time,\nskinny dipping every night, getting kicked off the beach at 4am, dirty dancing at the Daquiri Deck, spikeball vs Truck/Scandal) as well as\npeople I don&rsquo;t get to see that often (again at the Deck, and at the fields, and the beach, and random places in between).\n\nHope to do it all again next year.\n","content":"<article itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/BlogPosting\">\n  <h1 class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"time-link\">\n      <a href=\"/2017-10-22/nationals-2017\" title=\"October 22, 2017\">\n        <time datetime=\"2017-10-22 20:18:01\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">\n          Oct 22\n        </time>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <a class=\"js-collapse\" itemprop=\"name\">Nationals 2017</a>\n  </h1>\n  <div class=\"content js-start-hidden\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n    <p>Another year, another nationals.

We had the overall 1 seed (Amp), a\nseverely-underseeded Blackbird, and Ambiguously Grey - a team that finished 6th last year after starting out in the bottom half. Rockford,\nIL was very windy on Thurs and Fri, so the games were very upwind-downwind.\n\nOur first game against Blackbird was super-close the whole way. Our D got many chances to score upwind, but we couldn&rsquo;t convert any of them.\nBlackbird broke us twice in the first half, and was sitting pretty with the lead. In the second half, we started playing some of our\nstronger throwers on D, and finally got the upwind break, then the downwind break. The cap went on, and we were pulling upwind on universe\npoint. Miraculously, we got the D and worked it all the way upwind to score the break and pull out the win 12-11.\n\nAfter this amazing win, we kept rolling. We crushed AG 11-6 in a very windy second game, then faced off against Amp to earn the bye into\nquarters. This is the game I had been looking forward to. Amp was the 1 seed, but we had beaten them before and knew they were not\ninvincible. We started out really strong, scoring the first 3 points. Then we quickly gave up a few breaks to let Amp close, before breaking\nto take half 8-6. In the second half, we broke twice more, taking the win 12-9. They showed our game on Ultiworld, which was really cool for\nmy family. Even the Germans got to watch me play.\n\nWinning out on Thurs earned us a bye into quarters, and the right to play only one game a day until we lost. It also put Amp on the other\nside of the bracket, together with Drag'n Thrust, Slow White, and Mixtape (who lost to Mischief). This means we had the easiest road to\nfinals of any of the other teams. In quarters, we stomped Noise 15-7, sending us to semis (my first time playing in semis). There, we faced\na tough Mischief team. The wind died down, but we still made a lot of mistakes (dropping the very first pull, throwing several miscued\ndumps, etc). We also had several great plays (including a Callahan from John G). The game was very close throughout. We started down,\nclawed back to take half 8-7, went down 8-9, then scored 3 breaks in a row to basically seal the deal. We ended up winning 14-11, and making\nthe big game - finals against Slow White.\n\nSlow is definitely the team I wanted to play against in the finals. They were very good all around, but we had proven we could beat them if\nwe played well. I also have a lot of friends on that team, so playing against them is always fun. We started off the way we always do - by\ngiving up a few breaks. Slow broke us 3 times in a row. We regrouped and a few points later, broke them 3 times back. They broke again at\n6-5, we broke at 7-6 to take half 8-6. Being a second-half team, we were knew we had them right where we wanted them. However, tight subbing\nreally drained our stars, and we started making mistakes. They broke us at 8-7, then again at 9s to take the lead. Finally, up 12-11, they\nbroke us 3 times to win it 15-11. In retrospect, we definitely had the ability to win that game and I wish we had played it a bit\ndifferently.

The plan was to hike up to the Guli pass (Ð“ÑƒÐ»ÑŒÐ±Ð°), look over the edge,\nthen come down. But we started our hikes fairly late both days, so we missed the summit by about an hour or two (had to turn back in order\nto make it down in time). I&rsquo;d never been on an all-out hike like this. We carried all our food and gear with us. We camped on the glacier\nboth nights (first night on the rocks embedded in the ice, second night on the snow/ice itself). We used helmets, crampons, harnesses, and\nice picks.

But we started our hikes fairly late both days, so we missed the summit by about an hour or two (had to turn back in order\nto make it down in time). I&rsquo;d never been on an all-out hike like this. We carried all our food and gear with us. We camped on the glacier\nboth nights (first night on the rocks embedded in the ice, second night on the snow/ice itself). We used helmets, crampons, harnesses, and\nice picks.

We were allowed to rest\nbetween exercises, but suddenly stopping an exercise would be a penaly. It actually seemed to work out pretty well. I got through <span class=\"workout-unit\"><span class=\"number\">6</span> rounds + <span class=\"number\">8</span> reps </span>\nof the WOD. I felt tired at the end, but not super dead.

They were the favorite, with lots of solid club guys and\na deep roster. They only had two women, and we tried to take advantage of that, but I think it was pretty even. The whole game was very\nclose and very spirited. We forced middle the whole game (props to Bosco for the brilliant idea) and made sure we were subbing super fast.\nWe even created two subbing groups for the second half to make sure our lines were well-balanced.\n\nI think the force middle really got to them, because their offence (normally very fast-paced and trigger-happy) slowed down a lot. We often\nforced them to throw 20 or even 30 throws before they could score. Big props to the improved defense from everyone. On offense, Shockey\ndominated. He probably scored half our goals that game. Bosco started throwing him floaty dimeballs, and eventually I found my stride and hit\nhim on a few nice hucks too. I think he only got beat in the air once.\n\nWhen time ran out in the second half, the score was 20-20. They had just scored, so we decided it would be a universe-point game with us on\noffense. We subbed in our best line and started working the disc. After 3 throws, Bosco unleashes a floaty hammer to CJ for the win. It\nfloats a bit too long, and gets D-ed toward me. I catch it and throw CJ game-winner. A very exciting end to a very good game.\n\nTeam Wins\n\n\nForce middle. Damn smart.\nWe finally subbed at the right pace. I&rsquo;m just as guilty of staying on too long as anyone. I&rsquo;m happy we finally did it right.\nGreat execution on the force middle. Sideline presence was strong and got everyone into the game.

We scored twice as many points as they did, which is pretty\ndifficult to do in indoor. We were even missing our first-round guy, and started off with almost no guy subs because many of our guys were\nrunning late. Still, we played well, moved the disc to the break side easily, and got a lot of Ds.\n\nSecond game, the exact opposite. We started off pretty weak and went down 5-1. After a timeout, we refocused and picked up our game, but we\nstill struggled with poor spacing and unforced mistakes. Our opponents backed us hard and forced us to cut under, which we did.

Hard to say if it&rsquo;s my fitness, the cold, my decisionmaking, or all of the above.</p>\n\n<p>After practice, went to lunch and played 7 Wonders with a few of the guys.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"tags\">\n   # \n  \n    <a href=\"/practice\">practice</a>, \n  \n    <a href=\"/spinners\">spinners</a>\n  \n</div>\n\n  </div>\n</article>\n"}

The O line especially played well during the scrimmages, coming back to\nwin the zone scrimmage after being down, and not giving up a single turn in the endzone-closed scrimmage.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"tags\">\n   # \n  \n    <a href=\"/amp\">amp</a>, \n  \n    <a href=\"/practice\">practice</a>, \n  \n    <a href=\"/scrimmage\">scrimmage</a>\n  \n</div>\n\n  </div>\n</article>\n"}

We spent a good amount of time focusing on our redzone offense. We worked on the gravity cut, which turns out to be very hard to defend if you&rsquo;re close to the endzone. The third cut (to the cone, back across for the break, then force side to the back cone) is especially tricky to cover. If you don&rsquo;t sell out to get the IO, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to throw something in that area. If you do, the cut to the back cone is open. Doing this drill on O and on D really let us experiment with making the cut different ways and defending it different ways, and it really proved to me how hard it is to cover (if the thrower is close enough).\n\nAfter that, we went into some endzone-focused scrimmage. The O line really struggled here, and the D line played very well on D and on O. They were very smooth, only had one cut at a time to each threatening space, and broke the mark very well for goals. The O line had trouble scoring more than 2 or 3 in a row, and often the goals were quite contested. We were very frustrated towards the end of practice.\n\nFor our last drill, worked on a bit of transition O/D in the redzone. Here, the success of the lines swapped and the O line crushed it. Maybe it helped that it started to rain and the disc became very slippery, but the O line scored almost all their opportunities and got a good amount of Ds as well.\n\nMy takeaways from the practice are:\n\n\nWe should be way better about scoring in the redzone.

On the whole though, we performed below expectations and finished last (8th) despite our wins against Wildcard and Mischief.</p>\n\n<p>I played fairly well, though I did have some bad turnovers in the Cosa game and in our second Wildcard game. I also only played 2 points against Cosa and in our first Wildcard game. In the games that I had time to get into, I thought my cutting was fairly strong and my D on the turn was also good.</p>\n\n<p>Things I did well:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>inside breaks</li>\n<li>threatening deep, then cutting hard under (break and open), then slashing for the IO</li>\n<li>patience near the endzone</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Things to improve on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>reduce bad decision throws. I only had two or so, but that&rsquo;s two unnecessary risks.</li>\n<li>reduce execution mistakes. Had at least three here (two to Trey in the same point, probably tired mistakes).

We did a short warmup, then did the gauntlet D positioning drill, then went to scimmaging.\n\nMost of the time, we scrimmaged with the same format as the camping weekend: D pulls to O, O sets up on D on the endzone line. If O scores, they play D. If D scores, that&rsquo;s it. The playing was fun, but it was O that struggled a lot this time. We played well but made execution mistakes and didn&rsquo;t get them back. On the few times we got them back, we turned it over again. I don&rsquo;t think we got more than one or two breaks the whole time.\n\nIn the last 20 minutes, we tried a new format. Neither team was allowed to score within the first 30 seconds of their possession. The endzone was considered out of bounds. After a turn, the 30 seconds restarted. The goal is to encourage the D to play aggressive underneath defense (as teams do to us sometimes) and for the O to be chilly and really work to maintain possession. At first this was a fun twist. Several points went by with both teams being patient and swinging the disc among the handlers near the endzone until it was time to score. However, the D soon realized that they needed to shut down the dumps to prevent the easy strategy. Also we got tired of the longer points. The two factors combined to create a lot of stress, and the frustration really showed for both teams. The last point took about 10 minutes to end, with both teams having multiple drops (sometimes first-throw drops) and really struggling to assert themselves. Part of this was because we really emphasize pushing upfield and not throwing backwards, but once we got to the goal line and couldnt advance, we got stuck and didn&rsquo;t adjust well. Another part is that we need to practice being flexible and communicating on the field to solve problems.

{"url":"/2014-08-03/double-practice-camping","title":"Double Practice + Camping","contentClean":"Practice\n\nHad a great double practice at glorious Lums Pond State Park. We spent a lot of time scrimmaging and working on the triangle cutting drill. We focused on defense, throwing deep early, and threatening multiple spaces at once. I really enjoyed the triangle cutting drill. I think it simulated game situations well and really let us work on a lot of good habits.\n\nThe O-line motto for the weekend was &ldquo;play with tempo and trust&rdquo;. Miggs was coming back from surgery, so he provided feedback to the O line. I thought he was very helpful in setting the strategy (even the defensive strategy) and on giving individual feedback on throwing.\n\nThe O line won most of the scrimmages over the weekend. The format of the scimmages was this: if O scored the first goal, they would play defense as if it were a turn. If D scored the first goal, the point ended. Also, O never pulled to D. Instead, we would drop the disc in the endzone and then set up before checking the disc in. This was an interesting format, as it allowed the O to score twice before subs, but it also gave the D a chance to score while O was tired. I&rsquo;m not sure if this gave O an advantage or not, but the O line won most of the scrimmages on the weekend.\n\nOn the O line&rsquo;s O possessions, we tended to run sidestack or ho stack on the pull plays. On D, we ran aggressive marks (flat-no-inside or even straight-up at times) and tight D downfield. Half the time, we fronted the cutters and trusted the mark to take away the easy deep throw. Alex and Diana really punished us for this strategy, so we tried to play back-hip when they had the disc. When Diana came over to the O line, it became easier for us.\n\nPersonally, I think both my D and O really stepped up this weekend. Patrick&rsquo;s article on perfect positioning really came in handy. I spent a lot of time thinking about avoiding parallel foot positioning and I think that helped me respond to cutters faster. I covered Papa for most of the weekend. In the past I struggled to contain him, but this weekend I think I shut him down pretty often. One thing that Jill pointed out to me is that I spend too much time looking at the thrower and not enough time focusing on the person I&rsquo;m covering. I&rsquo;ll be working on that later this week. I also felt that my mark was pretty solid most of the weekend and my cutting is getting better as I practice it more.\n\nMy main downside is still my throwing. I don&rsquo;t think I had more than one or two decision errors, but I did have a bunch of execution mistakes. I rushed several throws when my mark was out of position or on the ground, and ended up turning them over. I even got handblocked once. I also overthrew Panna on what should have been a wide-open goal. Finally, I rushed the last point of the last game on Sunday and threw a dicey upline throw when I should have been looking to swing the disc.\n\nCamping\n\nBetween Saturday and Sunday practices, we camped at the campground in the park. The forecast called for rain all weekend, but it ended up only raining at night. Saturday was beautiful the whole day. Sunday was grey and soggy, but almost no actual rain fell on us.\n\nAt the campsite, we played disc golf and ate a bunch of food. Alex brought a giant steam pot and made a huge dinner for everyone: 15 lobsters and a ton of clams, mussels, shrimp, sausage, eggs, etc. It was the most gourmet meal I&rsquo;ve ever had while camping. Then we sat around a campfire, drank beer, and played games. It would have been perfect if not for the nasty park ranger who made us pour out the last of our beer. I thought she was gonna be cool about it (we weren&rsquo;t even being loud) but she was not fun at all.\n\nDiana and I did make one technical error. We set up our tent on a giant tarp. I thought it was a good idea, but I forgot that tent tarps are designed not to stick out past the edges of the tent. This keeps rainwater from pooling on the tarp. So when it rained at night, the water collected inside and most of our stuff got wet. We slept fine (the thermarests kept us out of the water) but packing up in the morning was annoying and drying everything in the evening was a chore. On the plus side, we had tons of dry socks because our AMP socks had just come in. I had them in my bucket, which kept them and most of my other stuff dry. The duffel bag did not stay fully dry, but it did OK compared to Diana&rsquo;s backpack, which got completely soaked. Lessons learned there.\n","content":"<article itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/BlogPosting\">\n  <h1 class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"time-link\">\n      <a href=\"/2014-08-03/double-practice-camping\" title=\"August 03, 2014\">\n        <time datetime=\"2014-08-03 20:00:00\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">\n          Aug 03\n        </time>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <a class=\"js-collapse\" itemprop=\"name\">Double Practice + Camping</a>\n  </h1>\n  <div class=\"content js-start-hidden\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n    <h2>Practice</h2>\n\n<p>Had a great double practice at glorious Lums Pond State Park.

Here&rsquo;s how it went down.\n\nFriday\n\nI started the weekend by fooling everyone into thinking that I&rsquo;m now the TD of wildwood. The crew asked me to send an email to every player at the tourney to tell them some useful info (be respectful, no glass on the beach, watch out for plainclothes cops, etc). But the way it came off, it was like I was making the announcement, and that&rsquo;s usually the TD&rsquo;s job. All weekend people came up to me asking about cops and saying they didn&rsquo;t know I was in charge of wildwood now. I set most of them straight, but sometimes it was easier to just go with it.\n\nFriday was also the start of our weekend-long game of Gems. Everyone started with 5 gems, and whoever had the most by the end of the weekend got to keep the trophy. People were flipcupping for gems, betting gems (I won 3 on an arm wrestle between Diana and Katie), and even giving gems away for things. It definitely spiced the weekend up.\n\nAfter pregaming at the house, we head for the Bolero. We danced for a bit, then bounced and went for ice cream and skinny-dipping in the ocean. The water was surprisingly warm, and the ice cream was surprisingly good - vanilla with strawberries on top. That sobered us up some, so we went home to party some more.\n\nSaturday\n\nOur theme for the weekend was a bit unusual: you must wear (at most) one article of clothing and it must cover your back. We had some interesting choices - dresses, panda suits, wrestling singlets, full-body spandex suits, even a kimono. I went with a fullbody suit on Saturday and a dress on Sunday. The suit was a big hit, and not all that bad to play in. I thought it would be super-hot (it was) and that throwing in those gloves would be tough (it wasn&rsquo;t). We spent most of the day drinking and chilling with people. We won all our games (both Troyalty and Troylettes) without too much of a struggle. One of the teams we played was solid, but we stepped our game up and won by 4, our closest win of the day.\n\nThe party was quite good this year, mostly because we didn&rsquo;t spend too much time at the Bolero.

After much socializing and big-containering and dice-gaming, our thoughts turned to food and we went to buy way more Chinese than we needed (though Singapore noodles were delicious). We ate on the steps near our house, then went in for the afterparty and for bedtime.\n\nSunday\n\nSunday went pretty similar to Saturday. The teams we played were better, but we were never down on points. Our two-pointers were decent, our guys were very solid, and our ladies carried the day as usual. I thought we&rsquo;d have trouble against Esser&rsquo;s team, but we went up big and they didn&rsquo;t manage to catch up in time. In the finals, we played Max Power, a Canadian team that played in Borocay and other beach tournaments. We talked them into playing Pick-6, which turned out great. I ran back a pick-6 for a goal, then threw a pick-6 Callahan shortly afterwards. Our first game to 7 was closer than it should have been. I threw a 2-pointer at 5-5 to win it, but it could have gone either way. Our second game was not as tight. I think we won 7-3 or 7-2. After the games, I played an awesome spirit game of 1-on-1 hockey in the sand. We each had a tiny hockey stick and the puck was a tennis ball.

We were up most of the way, starting from the first break, then taking half 8-6, then being up 12-9. But then, they scored 4 in a row and ended up winning 15-13. We played solid D and O for the most part, though we didn&rsquo;t go to the break side as much as I would have liked. Our main problem was our endzone O. When we had the disc on the line, we either struggled to score or failed completely. Jeff noticed it too, so hopefully we&rsquo;ll work on it next game. We also got beat deep too many times, especially by this one girl on their team.

We played solid D and O for the most part, though we didn&rsquo;t go to the break side as much as I would have liked. Our main problem was our endzone O. When we had the disc on the line, we either struggled to score or failed completely. Jeff noticed it too, so hopefully we&rsquo;ll work on it next game. We also got beat deep too many times, especially by this one girl on their team.

Unfortunately, this year did not live up to expectations.\n\nSaturday\n\nThe weather on Saturday was not bad. It wasn&rsquo;t sunny, but at least there was no wind and the ground was fairly dry. We played 3 teams - Maui Mana (a local team), Colony (an Australian club team preparing for worlds), and Club Prince (a Madcow-Bravo combo team). All the games were lopsided. We crushed Maui and got our ass kicked by the other two. The game against Prince was a bit closer than the other, but the finals score was 15-7 or so. We didn&rsquo;t play great.\n\nSunday\n\nThe weather got worse on Sunday. There was a lot of rain and the ground was very muddy by the time we played (11:45am start times today and yesterday). We played another local team and wrecked them, then played KUT (Carleton Alum) and got killed again. I skipped the second half of the first game and the first half of the second game to pick up with Ski Patrol, which made my day much more interesting. They were mostly Seattle guys with a few outside pickups (Brown, Zargham, Lucas). They play a very different style of ultimate - much more relaxed and dynamic, but still focused. I wish I&rsquo;d had more time to play with them. I did get to play half a game aginst Sofia Freaks, another unique and interesting team that I love playing against. They went up in the first half and took half 8-4. After I left, Ski Patrol rallied and won the game on universe point.\n\nAfter pool play ended, we played a prequarter game against Stanford Bloodthirsty. The game was close the whole way, with them leading by a bit, but we got a late break and won 13-12 when the game got capped. Stanford had a great deep game and their primary handlers played very well. We sucked on D and were decent on O. Everything was pretty sloppy. We also had a 15 min break when one of the Stanford guys hurt himself. In the end, the game got capped and we scored on O to win it.\n\nMonday\n\nWinning in prequarters earned us the right to play Ono in quarters. By this point, the fields were completely torn up and muddy. The wind made the game almost unplayable (it blew over the tournament tent early that morning) and most of us had trouble throwing and catching. Ono had several strong throwers, and they were able to convert several upwind breaks, which quickly lead to downwind breaks. It was shitty all around and we lost 15-6 or so.\n\n\n\nOverall I played very well for the first two days. Ignoring the Ono game (it was terrible ultimate), I had no throwing turnovers and just one drop  - a throw from Bhavin in the endzone that should have been an easy catch but I misread it a bit and then dropped the catch. I mostly cut, but did some handling and played a bunch of defense. I&rsquo;m especially happy with my offense. Maybe playing O line for Amp is a good move.\n","content":"<article itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/BlogPosting\">\n  <h1 class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"time-link\">\n      <a href=\"/2014-02-17/kaimana-klassik-27\" title=\"February 17, 2014\">\n        <time datetime=\"2014-02-17 00:00:00\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">\n          Feb 17\n        </time>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <a class=\"js-collapse\" itemprop=\"name\">Kaimana Klassik 27</a>\n  </h1>\n  <div class=\"content js-start-hidden\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n    <p>3 days of gorgeous weather, high-level ultimate and awesome partying &hellip; or at least that&rsquo;s the pitch.

We didn&rsquo;t play great.</p>\n\n<h2>Sunday</h2>\n\n<p>The weather got worse on Sunday. There was a lot of rain and the ground was very muddy by the time we played (11:45am start times today and yesterday). We played another local team and wrecked them, then played KUT (Carleton Alum) and got killed again. I skipped the second half of the first game and the first half of the second game to pick up with Ski Patrol, which made my day much more interesting. They were mostly Seattle guys with a few outside pickups (Brown, Zargham, Lucas). They play a very different style of ultimate - much more relaxed and dynamic, but still focused. I wish I&rsquo;d had more time to play with them. I did get to play half a game aginst Sofia Freaks, another unique and interesting team that I love playing against. They went up in the first half and took half 8-4. After I left, Ski Patrol rallied and won the game on universe point.</p>\n\n<p>After pool play ended, we played a prequarter game against Stanford Bloodthirsty. The game was close the whole way, with them leading by a bit, but we got a late break and won 13-12 when the game got capped. Stanford had a great deep game and their primary handlers played very well. We sucked on D and were decent on O. Everything was pretty sloppy. We also had a 15 min break when one of the Stanford guys hurt himself. In the end, the game got capped and we scored on O to win it.</p>\n\n<h2>Monday</h2>\n\n<p>Winning in prequarters earned us the right to play Ono in quarters. By this point, the fields were completely torn up and muddy. The wind made the game almost unplayable (it blew over the tournament tent early that morning) and most of us had trouble throwing and catching. Ono had several strong throwers, and they were able to convert several upwind breaks, which quickly lead to downwind breaks. It was shitty all around and we lost 15-6 or so.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Overall I played very well for the first two days. Ignoring the Ono game (it was terrible ultimate), I had no throwing turnovers and just one drop  - a throw from Bhavin in the endzone that should have been an easy catch but I misread it a bit and then dropped the catch. I mostly cut, but did some handling and played a bunch of defense. I&rsquo;m especially happy with my offense. Maybe playing O line for Amp is a good move.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"tags\">\n   # \n  \n    <a href=\"/kaimana\">kaimana</a>, \n  \n    <a href=\"/tournament\">tournament</a>, \n  \n    <a href=\"/ultimate\">ultimate</a>\n  \n</div>\n\n  </div>\n</article>\n"}

But we didn&rsquo;t really convert any breaks and they rode their first-half lead to the win.</p>\n\n<p>I ended up staying to watch the second game and throw with Cuatro. Then it turned out that Norm&rsquo;s team was shorthanded, so I picked up with them for my second game. They are a more experienced and disciplined team, so our game was a lot closer. Fern played especially well for us. But Drexel put together an athletic team and pulled away in the second half to secure their victory. Two losses in one night.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"tags\">\n   # \n  \n    <a href=\"/indoor\">indoor</a>, \n  \n    <a href=\"/ultimate\">ultimate</a>\n  \n</div>\n\n  </div>\n</article>\n"}

First drill was a give-and-go drill with 3 stationary receivers and one cutter running down the middle of the field. I liked the drill, but I&rsquo;m unsure about the in-game usefulness. Going from catch to throw quickly was good practice.

{"url":"/2013-08-18/fpsl-finals","title":"FPSL Finals","contentClean":"A great weekend for ultimate. The weather was perfect, our team was underrated, and we were poised to ruin some dreams. Our first game was Saturday afternoon against Bill and Stacy. We didn&rsquo;t come out strong, but victory was rarely in question. We kept it close through most of the game before pulling away to win 15-11. This put us in E pool and set up the long-awaited Vinny vs. Flagger matchup (on the showcase field, no less). Both teams were fairly drunk at this point, though Diana was actually sobering up after a very sloppy Game 1 BAC level. Turns out we play better when we&rsquo;re drunk (and when Ellis is there). I think we were up the whole game and won by a lot. I played one point with two giant cardboard hands taped to my hands, and Diana threw me the goal. Our victory put is in E pool semis, the first time I&rsquo;ve ever played on Sunday of Finals. Diana and I both finished the day at +2.\n\nOur first game on Sunday was against Butter and Raha&rsquo;s team. We were even more shorthanded than yesterday: only 5 guys. Our opponents went 5-2 on offense every time, so by the end of the game we were feeling pretty gassed. The game was close throughout though I think we led for pretty much the whole time. We won 15-13. Wolf and Max both had a stellar game. Wolf must have caught at least half of our goals and Max threw some beautiful long shots to him and others. Ben also played extremely well, with two spectacular layouts to maintain posession after crappy throws. Tired but undefeated, we moved on into E pool finals against Vanni, Harrison and their squad. Our lack of subs really showed this game. We quickly went down 0-4 and continued to struggle the whole game. The finals score was 15-7 bad guys, but we put up a fight to the very end. I had two layout Ds (my only layouts of the weekend) and a good long huck to Max. Diana threw me a nice huck for a goal, and Max continued to play excellent defense. I&rsquo;m not gonna talk about how many terrible decisions and throws I had because there were too many to remember.\n\nDespite our loss in the finals, I had a lot of fun.

The weather was perfect, our team was underrated, and we were poised to ruin some dreams. Our first game was Saturday afternoon against Bill and Stacy. We didn&rsquo;t come out strong, but victory was rarely in question. We kept it close through most of the game before pulling away to win 15-11. This put us in E pool and set up the long-awaited Vinny vs. Flagger matchup (on the showcase field, no less). Both teams were fairly drunk at this point, though Diana was actually sobering up after a very sloppy Game 1 BAC level. Turns out we play better when we&rsquo;re drunk (and when Ellis is there). I think we were up the whole game and won by a lot. I played one point with two giant cardboard hands taped to my hands, and Diana threw me the goal. Our victory put is in E pool semis, the first time I&rsquo;ve ever played on Sunday of Finals. Diana and I both finished the day at +2.</p>\n\n<p>Our first game on Sunday was against Butter and Raha&rsquo;s team. We were even more shorthanded than yesterday: only 5 guys. Our opponents went 5-2 on offense every time, so by the end of the game we were feeling pretty gassed. The game was close throughout though I think we led for pretty much the whole time. We won 15-13. Wolf and Max both had a stellar game. Wolf must have caught at least half of our goals and Max threw some beautiful long shots to him and others. Ben also played extremely well, with two spectacular layouts to maintain posession after crappy throws. Tired but undefeated, we moved on into E pool finals against Vanni, Harrison and their squad. Our lack of subs really showed this game. We quickly went down 0-4 and continued to struggle the whole game. The finals score was 15-7 bad guys, but we put up a fight to the very end. I had two layout Ds (my only layouts of the weekend) and a good long huck to Max. Diana threw me a nice huck for a goal, and Max continued to play excellent defense. I&rsquo;m not gonna talk about how many terrible decisions and throws I had because there were too many to remember.</p>\n\n<p>Despite our loss in the finals, I had a lot of fun. I played every point except one in both games on Sunday, and I played almost all of the points on Saturday until we started killing it in game 2. Now that ultimate is done for a month or so, it&rsquo;s time to focus 100% on Amp.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"tags\">\n   # \n  \n    <a href=\"/ultimate\">ultimate</a>\n  \n</div>\n\n  </div>\n</article>\n"}

The top teams in the country were in attendance - teams 5-16 from nationals last year. This was our first weekend as a full team with a finalized roster, and we stepped up our game bigtime. We took second in our pool with a 4-1 record (beating Odyssee, Mental Toss, Slow White and 7 Figures, and losing to CLX), which put us in the championship bracket.

{"url":"/2013-07-10/kilimanjaro","title":"Kilimanjaro","contentClean":"Spent two weeks in Tanzania. The first week, we hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro. Most of the hike was pretty easy and we were pampered quite a bit. I felt like a British explorer - having a tea break before dinner and being around green canvas tents all the time. The summit night, however, was the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done in my life. We woke up at midnight, ate a small meal, and spent the next six and a half hours getting to the top. It was dark, cold (below 0F) and there wasn&rsquo;t much oxygen. I felt fine at the start (4800m above sea level) but after a few hours, walking became pretty difficult. The cold didn&rsquo;t bother me as much, but the lack of oxygen was rough. I spent most of the second half of the climb just focusing on walking slowly. I was mentally repeating &ldquo;left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot&rdquo; to keep focused. As we neared the first summit (Stella Point), the sun started to rise. When I got there, it was glorious. I was (almost) at the roof of Africa. We took a short break to drink some tea with sugar, then continued on to the real summit (Uhuru Peak), which was over an hour away and 200m higher. This section was not as bad as getting to Stella Point because it was warmer, less steep and the end was in sight. At the peak, we took another short break and a bunch of pictures (including a mandatory handstand pic for me). Then we started our descent. Back at Stella Point, we took a few more pictures before heading back to camp. The descent took about an hour and a half. Then we slept for a bit, ate a little and went down another few hundred meters to a lower camp to make sure we don&rsquo;t get altitude sickness.\n","content":"<article itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/BlogPosting\">\n  <h1 class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"time-link\">\n      <a href=\"/2013-07-10/kilimanjaro\" title=\"July 10, 2013\">\n        <time datetime=\"2013-07-10 00:00:00\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">\n          Jul 10\n        </time>\n      </a>\n    </div>\n    <a class=\"js-collapse\" itemprop=\"name\">Kilimanjaro</a>\n  </h1>\n  <div class=\"content js-start-hidden\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n    <p>Spent two weeks in Tanzania.

(Are back-off sets useful after a strength workout?)\n\nSince power is at greater risk of the detraining effect than maximum strength, athletes whose sports require powerful movements should take care to avoid long periods of time spent without training.

They are all very fast and athletic and they play a different style of ultimate that I&rsquo;m used to. Instead of cuts coming primarily from the stack and toward the handlers, their first look is either to an upline handler cut or to a short cut from the front of the stack and then a leading dishie to a handler. It&rsquo;s very interesting - their momentum is always toward the endzone they are attacking and almost never away from it. This lets them always see the field and sets them up for great flow. However, no one on their team was over 6 feet tall and that really limits their deep game. They tried to throw it deep past us a few times but it rarely worked. That let us focus on taking away their short game and really limited their options. On O, we took advantage of the height mismatches and their need to back us and double/triple team us on deep cuts. I think we were up the whole game and ended up winning by 2.\n\nGame 2, we played Ono. They had a bunch of ex-Condors and mostly older guys, but they were very tall and had great throws.

The weather was beautiful (70 and sunny each day), our team was fun and we played 8 awesome games of beach ultimate.\n\nFriday Night\n\nMet the team. It was mostly the same team as last year. For guys, we traded Jon and a few west coast pickups for DanD, Jay Walker and Bill (Steve&rsquo;s friend from Albaquerque). For girls, only Catie remained from last year. We picked up KayKay, Kelsey, Val, Jill and Holly. We all pregamed at the hotel (played Val&rsquo;s Deck game), then partied at Rustys. I was reminded just how many players from New York come to Leiout. I think it&rsquo;s because they can&rsquo;t wait for Wildwood and need a beach ultimate fix.\n\nSaturday\n\nWe played pretty well most of the time, but ended up going 1-3. We lost at least one (maybe two) games where we were up at the end but relaxed too much and didn&rsquo;t finish strong. My throws were much better this year than last year, especially the hucks. I don&rsquo;t know what I changed, but I figured out how to throw floaty hucks out to space in front of receivers without throwing them out the back of the endzone. I still had some throwaways and stupid mistakes, but I felt pretty good overall. Max also played outstandingly. He made several very athletic grabs and skys. Turns out he&rsquo;s actually pretty good when he&rsquo;s not drunk.\n\nSat Night\n\nThai for dinner, more Deck, then tournament party. Compared to last year, this one was pretty lame. It had a lot of potential but they didn&rsquo;t do anything with it. The space was a large warehouse (reminds me of raves I went to in high school) with several tables/bars and one dancing crowd in front of the speakers. There was no place to sit, no games to play and no free drinks ($7 for a whiskey sour is kind of a lot). After we got bored, we went to Barnie&rsquo;s Beanery and played shufflepuck.\n\nSunday\n\nWe dropped down to become the 5 seed in a lower pool (I think it was F pool). We resolved to come out strong and maintain our focus, and that paid off. We won our first two games pretty easily and were up in the third, but hit a speed bump. The other team went up and had the disc in the endzone to win it, but their cutter dropped a wide-open throw for the goal. We scored, then broke them twice more for the win. It was extremely lucky, but we&rsquo;ll take it.\n\nIn the finals, we played a UCLA alum team. The game was close the whole time. We started up a point and took turns scoring and trading breaks. I think they were up after half but we broke them to go up one. Towards the end, we up 9-8 when Steve got a minor concussion. We scored the point to get to universe for us, but then our luck changed. They scored and we put on our universe line to end the game. We worked the disc very well, moving side to side and making steady progress up the field. We were about 10 feet from the endzone and just needed an easy goal, but Steve threw it sideways across the field and out of bounds. UCLA came back to score, then broke us twice more to seal the deal.\n\nSun Night\n\nLots of gyros, dinner at the Beanery, Deck, a late attempt at Rustys, Ale House, late night food search, Fuck the Dealer, more Deck.\n\nLessons\n\n\nEating is super important.

The study compared backhands, split-grip forehands and closed-grip forehands. The only differences they found were that split-grip forehands don&rsquo;t go as fast when you&rsquo;re throwing hard, and backhands have more spin when you don&rsquo;t throw them hard.

We were a lot better than I&rsquo;ve seen us play at any other tournament. Granted, the first two teams were pretty weak, but we played Muff'n Men last and beat them 13-5 (we lost to them in Sectionals pool play and then pulled out a 12-8 win in the 2-3 games). After games, we ate Thai food, chilled in the hot tub and played a poker tournament at the hotel.\n\nDay 2\n\nWe started the day playing against Ant Madness (the 4 seed). The game was a roller coaster of ups and downs. We took half 8-3, they tied it up at 9s, we went up 12-9, they closed the gap again. We managed to hold our lead until hard cap, winning 14-13. I&rsquo;d say we played pretty well for the most part. The weakest part of our game was our terrible deep shots. We often went deep to girls when there were guy defenders in the area, or put up floaters against their best deep defender. We also tried to throw at least 3 hammer hucks instead of putting up a normal huck or just swinging the disc.\n\nIn semis, we played Amp. This was the game I&rsquo;d been waiting for since I decided to play Termite&rsquo;s, but it didn&rsquo;t go the way I expected. We started off really really poorly, going down 5-1 or so and limping into half at 8-2. Once again, our deep game let us down as we threw floaty hucks into unfavorable situations. We also gave up a few poach Ds. To their credit, Amp played really well. They moved the disc well and their offense never seemed stagnant. We also didn&rsquo;t do good job (any job, really) of stopping their dump-swing, which is the core of their offense. In the second half, we stepped our game up, took away their dumps and matched them point for point, but it was too late by then. They won 15-9, knocking us out of nationals contention. On a positive note, I layout callahaned Butter&rsquo;s pushpass dump, thereby winning the layout D competition and a bottle of liquor from Shelley Su.\n\nWrap Up\n\nAmp went on to win the region and take the only bid to Nationals. They mounted a huge 7-point D run in the second half to come back from an 8-5 halftime deficit and crush Ambiguously Grey.

I&rsquo;m starting to realized that there are more nuances to dump defense than I thought.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"tags\">\n   # \n  \n    <a href=\"/gym\">gym</a>\n  \n</div>\n\n  </div>\n</article>\n"}

Here&rsquo;s the plan: flash for one full second, then 0, then 10, then no-around at 3-4 seconds. The no-around is 100 degrees, but think of it as a 10 mark but rotated 90 degrees. You still have to stop the IO, but only allow the dump to go directly backwards. As for guarding the dump, when the dump is on the open side, force them upfield (the no-around mark won&rsquo;t be very helpful here, so force the harder throw). When the dump is on the break side,  do NOT give up the upline (mark is allowing it) and force them directly back. When they are back there, give them 2-3 feet of cushion to bait the floaty dump, then get the D. Make sure to play close if the dump is even with or in front of the disc to prevent the IO.\n\nAfter practice and a nap, played against CTC.
