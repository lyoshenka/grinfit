    <p>Played some pickup in Weehawken, NJ with my dad and sister. Not the highest level, but just about everyone knew what they were doing and a few of them were pretty good. It was a lot of fun playing with my family. My dad even threw my a half-field flick for a goal. Admittedly, the field was pretty small and we were playing 5 vs 5, but it was still good. I tried to reciprocate, but didn&rsquo;t take the wind into account and made it a tough read. We didn&rsquo;t keep score and played last-back, but people weren&rsquo;t that eager to sub (esp at the end) so I got a lot of running in. So much running, in fact, that after we were done I realized that I did something bad to my calf. Hopefully I&rsquo;m 100% for Chesapeake.</p>

    <p>Norm and I did a short field workout at 48th and Woodland.</p>

<ul>
<li>4 suicides: 10,0,20,0. Rest while your partner sprints</li>
<li>A little bit of work on jumping form.</li>
<li>3 sets of 3x40m sprints. 10 seconds between each rep, 2 minutes between each set. Start each set with a different stance (e.g. right foot, left foot, sideways right foot, backwards left foot, pushup position, etc)</li>
<li>5 in-out cuts for hucks.</li>
<li>80m of burpee broad jumps for time. Place your hands where your feet are on each burpee (no gaining distance by falling forward). Sprint back after you&rsquo;re done. I did it in 3:23. The first third was pretty easy and I got a lot of distance on my jumps. After that, I had to slow down and eventually rest after each burpee.</li>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Did a fairly intense workout with Ross, Patrick, Norm, Diana, Saltz and Keg. It&rsquo;s similar to the PonyShape workouts we did last year.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 rounds of 4 minutes (8 sets) of Tabata Sprints (sprint 20 seconds, stop and rest 10 seconds). We ran between two cones that were 30 yards apart. Norm won the first round, Patrick won the second. I was close to first on both rounds but closer on the first than on the second.</li>
<li>3-man marking drill. Each person marks for 30 throws total, in 10-throw sets (mark for 10 throws, throw for the other guys, mark again). We added a rule that each point block is like having marked two throws. I had a lot of point blocks, so I would not use this rule next time.</li>
<li>Place two cones 40 yards apart. Split into pairs, start on opposite cones. Person A sprints to Person B and marks for 10 seconds as Person B pivots and fakes. Then Person A takes the disc and both people sprint back to the other cone. That&rsquo;s one rep. We did 6 reps (each person marked 3 times).</li>
<li>Place two cones 10 yards apart. 4 sets of 20 seconds side-shuffle, 20 seconds rest. Touch the cone before changing directions. Focus on getting low (chest up and squat low, dont just bend over).</li>
<li>AMRAP in 6 minutes: 15 pushups, 15 full-body crunches, 15 squats. I finished 5 rounds exactly.</li>
<li>Focused throwing. Emphasis on pivoting and stepping out.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was beat at the end of the AMRAP. I haven&rsquo;t done many Crossfit-style workouts this year and I tried to go hard (I kept up with Ross and Saltz on the first two rounds of the AMRAP), so I felt a bit nauseous. But I&rsquo;m surprisingly not sore the next day, so maybe my overall strength is up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Approximately 50 miles of walking (3 full days in Paris, a day in Brussels, a day in Bruges and an evening in Cologne)</li>
<li><a href="http://i.grin.io/pull-up-belfort-bruges.jpg">One pullup</a> and 366 stairs at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfry_of_Bruges">Belfort</a> in Bruges</li>
<li>About 20 minutes of throwing by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomium">Atomium</a> in Brussels</li>

<p>Not much, and it was probably negated by all the beer, crepes and waffles I ate.</p>

    <p>Played a good game against Yellow Sub on Sunday morning. We went up 3-0 but ended up losing by three (11-8, maybe). I had two throwaways but got several Ds and caught and threw about 6 points (including a two-pointer). We should have only lost by one because Norm dropped a two-pointer that was in his hand. Great game overall. My quad started to bother me at the end, so I sat out the next game and watched &copy;rabs kick our ass. Also, worked on my leftie backhand and scoober.</p>

    <p>Spinners ran a track workout and then scrimmaged. I&rsquo;m still resting my quad so I didn&rsquo;t run. Instead I did pushups, crunches, leg raises, and an exercise for my back where you&rsquo;re in a plank position and you alternate bringing one knee up toward your shoulder, then the other knee. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s called but it&rsquo;s pretty tiring.</p>

<p>After the track, we went up to the field and scrimmaged. We worked on making sure the disc does not stay on the sideline. Our D looked strong, though we had some trouble scoring from the red zone.</p>

<p>After the scrimmages, we had a fun scrimmage where we split up by SAT score (smart vs dumb). The smart team won the scrimmage 3-0.</p>

    <p>Last game of the regular season. We beat RI 29-20 or something like that. They only brought 12 guys, so they weren&rsquo;t taking this game seriously. We only played man on D because we didn&rsquo;t want to give away our defenses before the playoffs game. Overall, we played pretty well. We had trouble getting the disc off the sideline sometimes. Personally, I had a layout D and a blade for a goal in the same point, along with one or two caught goals. I played pretty well but got beat up the line and to the force-side cone a few times. Need to improve in those respects. I also had an up-line throw to Harrison that got Ded but he caught it anyway.</p>

<p>After the spinners game, Sean and I went to watch Termite&rsquo;s play their last game of the day at Philly Invite. They looked pretty sloppy, but that&rsquo;s to be expected of a new team with many of their top players not there. They went 0-4 on the day, but I saw some good plays from a few players, so I&rsquo;m excited for the future.</p>

<p>Watched the 3rd and 4th quarter of the Detroit game. Our D was fairly solid and we often got them stuck where we wanted them, but too often we let them out at the last second (typically on an in-cut or an up-line cut).</p>

I scored two goals and cut fairly well most of the time.</p>

<p>After the game, we showered (well, hosed off) and hung out at the bar waiting for our bus. We played two games of Mafia (the first had 25 people) and I won both of them (as mafia the first time, and as a townsperson the second time). Boom!</p>

    <h2>Track</h2>

<ul>
<li>Warmup: jog the curves, accelerate to a sprint over the first 50m of the straightaway, decelerate back to a jog over the last 50m.</li>
<li>5x200m, 2 min rest between sprints.</li>
<li>5 min rest</li>
<li>2x Whistle drill (described below)</li>
<li>5 min rest</li>
<li>4x40m, 15 sec rest between sprints.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Whistle Drill</h3>

<p>Start jogging. When you hear the whistle, sprint. When you hear the next whistle, jog. Repeat. When you hear a long whistle, the person at the front of the pack starts jogging in place. Everyone else jogs to where they are and keeps jogging in place there. On the next whistle, everyone&rsquo;s back to sprinting.</p>

<p>The interval between whistles is between 3 and 12 seconds (random). Each rep was a full lap (400m). I think we did about 5 or 6 sprints total. The rule for jogging is that your arms cannot fall below your waist and your feet have to come up to your shins on each step (no baby-stepping).</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Start off with hunger drill, with each person taking turns throwing and the offense has to catch with both hands. Did backhands and flicks. Then moved on to scrimmage for 5 pulls. The D worked on zone-to-man for the first 5 pulls, then ran wolf for the next 5 (from a standstill). O and D took turns going through wolf. I honestly think the O did it better. They run a diamond in the backfield and do more switching than we do. After wolf, we played a 5 min game that went into overtime, then sudden death. The D got a turn and worked it up, but we turned it over on the goal line (I threw a dump over Panna&rsquo;s head). Then O scored.</p>

    <p>The whole team paid the piper at practice. Lots of pushups, planks, squats, &lsquo;sun gods&rsquo; (hold your arms straight out, palms up), and jogging in lockstep. Then we worked on defending upline cuts on the dump (force them in, if they go behind you then turn towards the disc and use your arms to feel where they go) and baiting an IO to the front of the stack. We also worked on communicating on our cuts so we don&rsquo;t have timing issues. Then we watched film for an hour at Sussex.</p>
