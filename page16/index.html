    <p>Played an hour of indoor at Woodbridge. We played a team of fairly young but very athletic players. They all ran pretty hard, and one guy
had really nice throws that he used to find the endzone a lot. They only had one girl, but she also played very well most of the time. She
got really tired at the end. Our team was lacking most of our strong players, and we didn&rsquo;t play very well at first. Eventually we got our
shit together and stopped turning it over so much.</p>

<li>5x6 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBsDSSHzeJA">Batwings</a> (rest 1:30 after each set)</li>
</ul>


<p>Squat weights:</p>

<ul>
<li>First set of 6 should be around 55% of 1RM</li>
<li>2nd set of 4 should be heavier than 1st set of 4</li>
<li>Last set of 3 should be same, or more, than set of 2</li>
</ul>


<p>My squats were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span>@<span class="number">125</span>lb, <span class="number">4</span>@<span class="number">155</span>lb, <span class="number">2</span>@<span class="number">205</span>lb, <span class="number">4</span>@<span class="number">175</span>lb, <span class="number">3</span>@<span class="number">205</span>lb </span>, and I used <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">30</span>lb </span> DBs for the batwings.</p>

<p>The coaches told me that I tend to come up on my toes during the squat. I took my sneakers off and went barefoot for the last few sets,
which seems to have helped a good amount. The cues I need to focus on are squeezing my butt the whole time (starting at the bottom and up
through the whole set) and pushing with my heels.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 Rounds for Reps</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Back Squats @70% of 1RM</li>
<li>Max Unbroken Ring Rows (up to 20)</li>
</ul>


<p>Between each round, rest 2x as long as your round took.</p>

<p>I used <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">155</span>lb </span> for back squats and did <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">8</span>,<span class="number">8</span>,<span class="number">7</span> </span> ring rows.</p>

    <p>Two games, two very different results. First game, we smoked our opponents. We scored twice as many points as they did, which is pretty
difficult to do in indoor. We were even missing our first-round guy, and started off with almost no guy subs because many of our guys were
running late. Still, we played well, moved the disc to the break side easily, and got a lot of Ds.</p>

<p>Second game, the exact opposite. We started off pretty weak and went down 5-1. After a timeout, we refocused and picked up our game, but we
still struggled with poor spacing and unforced mistakes. Our opponents backed us hard and forced us to cut under, which we did. But we moved
the disc to the open side too readily and got stuck in the black hole corner too often. People didn&rsquo;t stay out of the endzone, so scoring
was also difficult. And on turns, our defense was lacking. We did close the gap to 3 points at the very end, but they were in control the
whole time and milked the clock nicely to end the game.</p>

    <p>After lot of team shifts and last-minute scrambling for players, we scraped together a squad to send to Clambake. I only knew half the team
going into the weekend, but they turned out to be a great bunch. We also had people drop and pick up as the tourney progressed. We ended up
winning all our pool games and making it all the way to semis before Silence of the Clams knocked us out. The weekend was cold and windy on
the whole, so a lot of games were upwind-downwind turnoverfests. Our &ldquo;bobbing for shots&rdquo; game went over really well during the day. The game
didnt make it to the party because we went hard pretty early and lost focus.</p>

<p>The most difficult part was the second round. The pullups got really slow (2 at a time

then powered through on the bike to make sure I got done before the cap.</p>

    <p>First night of fall league. Met my team, which turned out to be pretty
cool. I was told it was very top-heavy, but I think all the players are at
least decent. No one&rsquo;s unathletic. We lost our first game to Bosco&rsquo;s team
by 1, then beat shockey&rsquo;s team by 1. Everyone played well, though some of
the newer players need some coaching. I got a decent number of Ds (mostly
poach Ds) and threw some nice goals (mostly to Kamil). Indoor is a great
workout.</p>

    <p>3 days of ultimate with Metro North. Played 7 games total. Didn&rsquo;t play that great overall, but improved throughout the weekend. Best game was the last game against Wildcard.</p>

<p>In general, my main places to improve are fitness (as always), throwing, and switching my mindset from D to O. My biggest issue was too many bad throwing decisions after getting a turn. I play much better when I look for breaks and move the disc quickly, not try to huck it. I don&rsquo;t think I completed any hucks at all this weekend.</p>

<p>Btw, we finished 7th at nationals and qualified for the Pro Flight for next year.</p>

    <p>My first Northeast regionals experience. Pool play on Saturday was fairly
easy. I think we beat every team by at least 6-7 points. Winning our pool
put us up against Slow White in semis. That was one of the best games we&rsquo;ve
played all year. I didn&rsquo;t play much (only a few points), but the team
played well as a whole and we won on universe point. Since there are 4 bids
this year, winning against Slow (only the 2nd time I&rsquo;ve ever beaten them)
made sure that we qualified for nationals, since we couldn&rsquo;t do worse than
3rd at that point.</p>

<p>On Sunday, we played Wildcard in the finals. The game was decent but they
played very strong D, went up 8-6 in the first half, then scored a few more
breaks in the second to seal the win. Then we played Slow White again in
the 2-3 placement game. Once again a solid game. This time they came out on
top. Our defense converted 2 breaks (same as Saturday) but O gave up a few
more that we couldn&rsquo;t make up for.</p>

<p>T minus 18 days until Nationals.</p>

    <p>Signed up last-minute for a hat tournament in Enfield (just north of Hartford). Ended up on Barb and Timmer&rsquo;s team. We started off weak, getting crushed in our first game. But then we dug in and won the next two pool games and three straight semis games to win the tourney. The final was us vs. the team we lost to first game. We were really tired (the day was HOT) and had lost some players to injury and concerts, so we picked up a few replacements. They also lost their best player, but picked up quality replacements as well. Victory was sweet, esp because we got a round of free wings for winning. I also met a bunch of cool CT ultimate players.</p>

    <h2>Strength/Skill Work</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Eccentric Handstand Pushups, focussing on form</li>
<li>8 DB Skull Crushers</li>
</ul>


<p>My handstand form was pretty weak. I tended to arch my back too much. Most of the reps, I focussed on bringing my ribs in, keeping my body tight, and my hands close to the wall. The coach gave me a good cue to focus on form: lie down facedown on the mat with your arms overhead against the bottom of a wall. That&rsquo;s the form for a handstand. Focus on what that feels like and keep that form.</p>

<p>For skull crushers, I used <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">12.5</span># </span> dumbbells, but should go up next time.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>Two 6min AMRAP WODs with a twist. Each WOD starts with a buy-in, which you have to do before you start counting rounds.</p>

<p>Rest 3 min between WODs</p>

<h3>First WOD</h3>

<p>Buy-in: 100m Bear Crawl. Then, with the time remaining:</p>

<ul>
<li>100m Run</li>
<li>10 Box Jumps (24in)</li>
</ul>


<p>Did 3 rounds, the run, and 7 box jumps in the 4th round. So close&hellip;</p>

<h3>Second WOD</h3>

<p>Buy-in: 400m Run. Then,</p>

<ul>
<li>20 Total Walking Lunge Steps</li>
<li>10/arm DB Snatch</li>
</ul>


<p>Got through 2 rounds plus 10 snatches with one arm.</p>

    <p>Got home from Crossfit just in time to see that a critical mass had gathered for mini. Ended up going despite feeling tired, and was pretty happy that I went. Special guest Tree joined us for the games. We played for a while, then finished with a 3-team round-robin.</p>

    <h2>Strength/Skill Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Back Squat 3x5 @ 75% 1RM</li>
<li>Ab Rollouts 3x10</li>
</ul>


<p>Used 170lb for the squats and 25lb plates on a bar for the rollout. Rollouts were harder than what I&rsquo;m used to with the ab wheel.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time:</p>

<ul>
<li>20 Back Squats (from floor)</li>
<li>40 Tuck Ups</li>
<li>400m Run</li>
<li>15 Back Squats</li>
<li>30 Tuck Ups</li>
<li>300m Run</li>
<li>10 Back Squats</li>
<li>20 Tuck Ups</li>
<li>200m Run</li>
</ul>


<p>Did it in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">12</span>:<span class="number">29</span> </span> with 115lb on the bar. Cleaning/pressing the bar off the floor before each set was an interesting new twist.</p>
