  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played a really fun goaltimate tournament in Boston. The tourney was really high-level - all elite club players who play a lot of goalty. I
started out playing pretty poorly but learned a lot and got significantly better throughout the day. Our team lost all our games, but then
we played a few hours of pickup, which was even better than the games.</p>

<p>The main things I learned are that the easiest way to score is to get the disc in front of the goal, in the middle. Then have one person
stand behind the scoring circle (a few feet back). This forces their defender to choose to look at them or the thrower. It also makes sure
they can&rsquo;t hang out in the middle, and have to either play tight on you (which lets you cut in for the goal) or play loose, which lets the
thrower throw it over them to you. You can also score by making a horizontal cut behind the goal into the scoring space. In general, as with
ultimate, its easiest to score by cutting into the space where you want the disc, not by already being there.</p>

<p>After the tourney, we went to a space-themed Halloween party, played a bunch of flipcup, ate delicious pie, and hoverboarded on PK&rsquo;s balance
board. I got home after 3am.</p>

    <p>Another strong finish by the Rockford Peaches in fall league, though we played quite poorly in our second game. The guys didn&rsquo;t have many
subs, so our rotation was pretty tight. Our decision-making got really bad in the second game, especially towards the end. There was a
10-minute stretch right out of half where neither team scored a goal. We even called a timeout to talk about reining in our throws and going
for the easy ones, but then kept making bad choices even after that. In the end, we did manage to turn down the aggresiveness and score some
easy, patient goals. It also helped that the other team was missing Bosco, their best player.</p>

<p>Since Halloween is on Saturday, we all dressed up as the Peaches - pink dresses, red socks and hats. Our team was the best-dressed of the
evening.</p>

<li>6,4,2,4,3 Front Squat (rest 1:30 after each set)</li>

<p>Squats were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span>@<span class="number">95</span>lb </span>, <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">4</span>@<span class="number">125</span>lb </span>, <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">2</span>@<span class="number">155</span>lb </span>, <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">4</span>@<span class="number">155</span>lb </span>, <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">3</span>@<span class="number">175</span>lb </span>. Pullups were pretty weak. I think I only did
3-4 each time. Was feeling pretty sore from earlier.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time - 8:00 Cap</p>

<ul>
<li>21,15,9 Front Squats</li>
<li>15,12,9 Pullups</li>

<p><span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">4</span>:<span class="number">17</span> </span> with <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">85</span>lb </span> for front squats.</p>

<p>I scaled the pullups down to 15,12,9 because I didn&rsquo;t think I could do 21-15-9 fast, and the goal was to go fast and not struggle too much.
It ended up being basically exactly right. I do wish I knew that Rx weight for squats was 95. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I could have done that.</p>

    <p>Played an hour of indoor at Woodbridge. We played a team of fairly young but very athletic players. They all ran pretty hard, and one guy
had really nice throws that he used to find the endzone a lot. They only had one girl, but she also played very well most of the time. She
got really tired at the end. Our team was lacking most of our strong players, and we didn&rsquo;t play very well at first. Eventually we got our
shit together and stopped turning it over so much.</p>

<p>The coaches told me that I tend to come up on my toes during the squat. I took my sneakers off and went barefoot for the last few sets,

through the whole set) and pushing with my heels.</p>

    <p>Two games, two very different results. First game, we smoked our opponents. We scored twice as many points as they did, which is pretty
difficult to do in indoor. We were even missing our first-round guy, and started off with almost no guy subs because many of our guys were
running late. Still, we played well, moved the disc to the break side easily, and got a lot of Ds.</p>

<p>Second game, the exact opposite. We started off pretty weak and went down 5-1. After a timeout, we refocused and picked up our game, but we
still struggled with poor spacing and unforced mistakes. Our opponents backed us hard and forced us to cut under, which we did. But we moved
the disc to the open side too readily and got stuck in the black hole corner too often. People didn&rsquo;t stay out of the endzone, so scoring
was also difficult. And on turns, our defense was lacking. We did close the gap to 3 points at the very end, but they were in control the
whole time and milked the clock nicely to end the game.</p>

going into the weekend, but they turned out to be a great bunch. We also had people drop and pick up as the tourney progressed. We ended up
winning all our pool games and making it all the way to semis before Silence of the Clams knocked us out. The weekend was cold and windy on
the whole, so a lot of games were upwind-downwind turnoverfests. Our &ldquo;bobbing for shots&rdquo; game went over really well during the day. The game
didnt make it to the party because we went hard pretty early and lost focus.</p>

    <p>Played Woodbridge fall league with Team Reptar. Our opponents were pretty weak, so it wasn&rsquo;t the best game, but I still enjoyed the
unexcepted opportunity to run around and play. Gonna start playing with them every weekend, I think.</p>

    <p>First night of fall league. Met my team, which turned out to be pretty
cool. I was told it was very top-heavy, but I think all the players are at
least decent. No one&rsquo;s unathletic. We lost our first game to Bosco&rsquo;s team
by 1, then beat shockey&rsquo;s team by 1. Everyone played well, though some of
the newer players need some coaching. I got a decent number of Ds (mostly
poach Ds) and threw some nice goals (mostly to Kamil). Indoor is a great
workout.</p>

    <p>3 days of ultimate with Metro North. Played 7 games total. Didn&rsquo;t play that great overall, but improved throughout the weekend. Best game was the last game against Wildcard.</p>

<p>In general, my main places to improve are fitness (as always), throwing, and switching my mindset from D to O. My biggest issue was too many bad throwing decisions after getting a turn. I play much better when I look for breaks and move the disc quickly, not try to huck it. I don&rsquo;t think I completed any hucks at all this weekend.</p>

<p>Btw, we finished 7th at nationals and qualified for the Pro Flight for next year.</p>

    <p>Last mini before nationals. We had 4 guys and 4 girls, so we had a good rotation going and a good mix of 2-1 and 1-2. I even got to play on the same line as Shockey, for the first time all season.</p>

    <h2>Strength/Skill Work</h2>

<p>Work on shoulder press. Build up to a heavy single. I started at 50% of my last PR (~70lb) and worked up to 1x105lb.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>5 rounds for time of:</p>

<ul>
<li>6 Push Press (from floor) @ your shoulder press 1RM</li>
<li>10 box jumps (my heel is still hurt so I subbed in 4 calories on the AirBike instead of box jumps)</li>
</ul>


<p>I used 105lb for my weight and finshed in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">7</span>:<span class="number">15</span> </span>. I did the first two PP sets unbroken, and split the rest 3/3.</p>

<p>Feels good to back to the gym.</p>

    <p>My first Northeast regionals experience. Pool play on Saturday was fairly
easy. I think we beat every team by at least 6-7 points. Winning our pool
put us up against Slow White in semis. That was one of the best games we&rsquo;ve
played all year. I didn&rsquo;t play much (only a few points), but the team
played well as a whole and we won on universe point. Since there are 4 bids
this year, winning against Slow (only the 2nd time I&rsquo;ve ever beaten them)
made sure that we qualified for nationals, since we couldn&rsquo;t do worse than
3rd at that point.</p>

<p>On Sunday, we played Wildcard in the finals. The game was decent but they
played very strong D, went up 8-6 in the first half, then scored a few more
breaks in the second to seal the win. Then we played Slow White again in
the 2-3 placement game. Once again a solid game. This time they came out on
top. Our defense converted 2 breaks (same as Saturday) but O gave up a few
more that we couldn&rsquo;t make up for.</p>

<p>T minus 18 days until Nationals.</p>
