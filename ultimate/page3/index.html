    <p>Played Woodbridge fall league with Team Reptar. Our opponents were pretty weak, so it wasn&rsquo;t the best game, but I still enjoyed the
unexcepted opportunity to run around and play. Gonna start playing with them every weekend, I think.</p>

    <p>First night of fall league. Met my team, which turned out to be pretty
cool. I was told it was very top-heavy, but I think all the players are at
least decent. No one&rsquo;s unathletic. We lost our first game to Bosco&rsquo;s team
by 1, then beat shockey&rsquo;s team by 1. Everyone played well, though some of
the newer players need some coaching. I got a decent number of Ds (mostly
poach Ds) and threw some nice goals (mostly to Kamil). Indoor is a great
workout.</p>

    <p>3 days of ultimate with Metro North. Played 7 games total. Didn&rsquo;t play that great overall, but improved throughout the weekend. Best game was the last game against Wildcard.</p>

<p>In general, my main places to improve are fitness (as always), throwing, and switching my mindset from D to O. My biggest issue was too many bad throwing decisions after getting a turn. I play much better when I look for breaks and move the disc quickly, not try to huck it. I don&rsquo;t think I completed any hucks at all this weekend.</p>

<p>Btw, we finished 7th at nationals and qualified for the Pro Flight for next year.</p>

    <p>My first Northeast regionals experience. Pool play on Saturday was fairly
easy. I think we beat every team by at least 6-7 points. Winning our pool
put us up against Slow White in semis. That was one of the best games we&rsquo;ve
played all year. I didn&rsquo;t play much (only a few points), but the team
played well as a whole and we won on universe point. Since there are 4 bids
this year, winning against Slow (only the 2nd time I&rsquo;ve ever beaten them)
made sure that we qualified for nationals, since we couldn&rsquo;t do worse than
3rd at that point.</p>

<p>On Sunday, we played Wildcard in the finals. The game was decent but they
played very strong D, went up 8-6 in the first half, then scored a few more
breaks in the second to seal the win. Then we played Slow White again in
the 2-3 placement game. Once again a solid game. This time they came out on
top. Our defense converted 2 breaks (same as Saturday) but O gave up a few
more that we couldn&rsquo;t make up for.</p>

<p>T minus 18 days until Nationals.</p>

    <p>Signed up last-minute for a hat tournament in Enfield (just north of Hartford). Ended up on Barb and Timmer&rsquo;s team. We started off weak, getting crushed in our first game. But then we dug in and won the next two pool games and three straight semis games to win the tourney. The final was us vs. the team we lost to first game. We were really tired (the day was HOT) and had lost some players to injury and concerts, so we picked up a few replacements. They also lost their best player, but picked up quality replacements as well. Victory was sweet, esp because we got a round of free wings for winning. I also met a bunch of cool CT ultimate players.</p>

    <p>In some ways the worst Wildwood yet. Cops were super annoying, got a $333 ticket for open display of alcohol. Played quite poorly most of the time.
Shrooms didn&rsquo;t do much. Diana wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>In another sense, tourney was pretty good. Weather was great - not scorching hot, not pouring rain. Cline&rsquo;s dance party at Stardust was sick. Stayed up
till 4am both nights, got quite drunk but wasn&rsquo;t hung over. Partied with lots of people I like. Played well against Rabs and Humiliswag. Saved a bunch of
money by sleeping in my car (the ppl whose house I slept in front of were not too happy). Chilled with Jennie, Barb, Robb and Max a good amount.</p>

Sunday. The finals was my best game - no turns, at least 4 assists, a
handful of Ds, and a hand block followed by a Rochester for the goal. We
won $1000, threw it in the air, swam in it naked and swaggered around as
much as we could.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Didn&rsquo;t do too much in the way of workouts conditioning. Mostly played ultimate:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 hours at a PoNY tryout. Didn&rsquo;t make the team.</li>
<li>2 days at Mixed Easterns with Metro North. Handled a lot.</li>
<li>1-day round-robin at Lums Pond in DE. Played against AG, AMP, Tyranis and Jug Handle. Also handled a good amount, primarily for the D line.</li>
<li>3 days at Windmill Windup with Cambridge. Played a lot against some good teams. Fairly happy with my play. Got one of the most difficult and awesome
layout Ds of my life.</li>
<li>4 days of beach ultimate at Bar Do Peixe. Definitely more relaxed that the rest of the tourneys, but still a lot of fun and pretty high quality. Played
a total of 11 games, though they were about half an hour each. Played with some awesome women, including probably the best girl in Portugal. Highlights
include my first layout handblock, a hammer handblock, some good D and strong intensity and focus under pressure (sometimes). Also ridiculous partying
every single night, especially Saturday and Sunday.</li>
</ul>


<p>Today, a return to real workouts. Threw with Miriam at Wooster Square for over an hour. Worked on torso torque on my flicks, spin on my leftie backhands, and flight path on my hammers.</p>

    <h2>Sri Lanka</h2>

<p>Two days of low-level pickup. Sri Lanka doesn&rsquo;t have much of an ultimate
scene, but a few players are trying to get it off the ground. They run
pickup several times a week in Colombo, and occasionally travel to other
cities to play. A few of the players have been to tournaments outside the
country (Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia) but most are casual players.</p>

<p>The pickup itself was fun. The weather was really hot and humid. I didn&rsquo;t
have cleats, so I played in my barefoot shoes. There wasn&rsquo;t much stacking
or force-holding, but everyone knew the rules and played with a lot of
spirit and competitiveness.</p>

<h2>Malaysia</h2>

<p>Diana and I picked up with teams for a day of ultimate at the Grizzly Open.
Diana played with the local powerhouse Care Bears. I played with (and even
captained) a team of pickup players from the area. We both had a lot of fun
playing and teaching. Diana even won the tourney in a very close game.</p>

bogusness, but overall it was a glorious time. We lost in the semis of the middle bracket, played 8 games on the weekend, and sang
&ldquo;Everything is Drinking&rdquo; at least 50 times. Max also got birthdayed at the sushi place and Markham won the party.</p>

bad throws in the 4th quarter. I also hurt my knee on a high layout in the middle of the game, but that seems to be doing better.</p>

    <p>Played a WL game against Vanni&rsquo;s team. We had all of our guys there, so I didn&rsquo;t really play that much. They also weren&rsquo;t that strong, so the game was
pretty relaxed for us. My fav play of the night was Robb throwing me a thumber just outside the endzone, and then me turning and throwing Billy a
Rochester for the score. Final score: 39-15</p>

    <p>Overnight tourney in Pittsburgh. Not sure how much I&rsquo;ll play, but if I
can&rsquo;t run I&rsquo;ll definitely be working out on the sideline.</p>

    <p>Had an excellent time playing with the Molar Bears at Mosh this weekend. For a first-year team, we set the bar pretty high for level of play, level of
fun, and finish in the tourney (lost in the finals). The wind was rough and the cold was somewhat annoying, but I had a lot of fun.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>

<ul>
<li>drinking tea on the sideline</li>
<li>recruiting for the team turned out awesome</li>
<li>everyone was very positive, had a lot of fun and partied pretty hard (though separately). need to have unified party next time.</li>
<li>every team except Trey&rsquo;s played pick-6</li>
<li>the rollers-are-live rule was fantastic in strong wind</li>
<li>my wind throws have gotten better, and my throwing turns came more from lazy throws</li>
<li>we beat Trey&rsquo;s team on universe</li>
<li>jeremy skied 3 guys in the endzone while wearing fairy wings</li>
<li>jeremy dropped a hand-on-hip hammer for an upwind break in the finals</li>
<li>papa owes me a buffalo</li>
<li>I threw a Rochester for a goal (to the break side to the front of the stack)</li>
<li>I threw Diana a honey goal. She played with her boot on and still got Ds and was effective.</li>
<li>the costumes. next year, no jerseys</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Bicuspids bite, molars crush<br>
Bears love cold. Let&rsquo;s win Mosh</p></blockquote>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<ul>
<li>if the wind is so strong that scoring upwind is tough, choosing the wind is equivalent to choosing O/D</li>
<li>conversely, starting on O upwind is good for focus and mental prep. accept the challenge.</li>
<li>we lost in the finals in part because of lack of leadership.

<ul>
<li>we were up 7-5 after half and playing D downwind. we should have broken for 8-5, then
overloaded our O and sealed the deal</li>
<li>millersville adjusted to our strategy at half. we didnt. we should have tried to play more handler-y O going downwind, and I should have called
handlers (scottie and brown) to play upwind O points.</li>
<li>I should have put myself into the cup to stop their crashes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as the captain, I did a good job keeping the vibe positive but I did not attend to the team&rsquo;s needs. I got caught up playing and talking from the
sideline, but I needed to take a step back (multiple times throughout the game) and ask myself &ldquo;what does the team need? what have I done already and
what am I not doing yet?&rdquo;</li>
<li>catch my Ds, then run them back for goals</li>
<li>continue to work on throws in the wind, esp flicks and hammers and short-range throws</li>
</ul>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We cruised through regionals, winning all our games by a good margin. No team made it to double digits against us. Our O line didn&rsquo;t get broken once all
weekend, and we had very few unforced turns all around. The intensity was good, even when we were winning by a lot.</p>

<p>We spent an hour or so on Saturday talking about spirit. Amp often gets low spirit scores, though we don&rsquo;t think we have poor spirit. So there must be
something we&rsquo;re missing, something we need to pay attention to and improve so we&rsquo;re not seen as jerks. Some good points were that we want the teams we beat
to cheer for us and be proud when we represent the region. We don&rsquo;t have to make friendly banter on the sidelines or smile at everyone, but we do need to
respect our opponents as worthy adversaries and recognize when they are doing something well. Some teams we mentioned as examples of good spirit are Polar
Bears, Slow White, Fury, Riot, the men on CLX.</p>

<p>For me personally, I played well on the weekend, though I didn&rsquo;t play much (esp on Saturday). I did have one drop and one rushed semi-throwaway that I
should not have had, but besides that I think I was very effective all around. I did notice myself rushing during our last game. I&rsquo;ll try to remember that
feeling so I can notice it in myself in the future. Brayden (the AG coach) also gave me some good feedback during the game.</p>

<ul>
<li>When I&rsquo;m marked tightly on the flick side, I lift my pivot slightly as I throw to get space. But that&rsquo;s still a travel. I need to either call disc space
or do something else (pivot?) to get the space I need.</li>
<li>When I&rsquo;m near the endzone (or downfield too), I get locked in on one person and wait for them to make the move I want them to make. I need to be careful
of spending too much time on one person. Instead, I should either communicate where I want them to go, or to another cutter.</li>
<li>When I throw the disc laterally from the break side towards the middle, I MUST remember to cut upline immediately. I should practice this.</li>
<li>I made the same dump mistake that I made a few weeks ago in practice (and Katie was my dump again). The mark was counting stalls a bit quickly, so I was
rushed in my head. I turned to look at my dump, but then immediately turned back upfield. I need to commit to the dump and stay with her for at least a
few seconds before looking elsewhere. She&rsquo;s waiting for my look to make her cut, so I can&rsquo;t expect her to be open right away.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rush so much. Learn to notice it and relax when it happens. I think this may lead to my frantic cutting as well.</li>
</ul>
