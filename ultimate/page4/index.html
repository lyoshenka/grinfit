    <p>Two days of camping and ultimate in beautiful Burlington, WA. This was basically mini-Nationals, as the top 8 teams from last year were there. A lot of unexpected results on the weekend - Drag'n Thrust only won 2 games, Cosa Nostra played better than expected, we finally beat Wildcard. On the whole though, we performed below expectations and finished last (8th) despite our wins against Wildcard and Mischief.</p>

<p>I played fairly well, though I did have some bad turnovers in the Cosa game and in our second Wildcard game. I also only played 2 points against Cosa and in our first Wildcard game. In the games that I had time to get into, I thought my cutting was fairly strong and my D on the turn was also good.</p>

<p>Things I did well:</p>

<ul>
<li>inside breaks</li>
<li>threatening deep, then cutting hard under (break and open), then slashing for the IO</li>
<li>patience near the endzone</li>
</ul>


<p>Things to improve on:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce bad decision throws. I only had two or so, but that&rsquo;s two unnecessary risks.</li>
<li>reduce execution mistakes. Had at least three here (two to Trey in the same point, probably tired mistakes). I&rsquo;ve been working on throwing harder, I think that will help.</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t get caught looking away from the guy I&rsquo;m covering. Focus on him and my footwork, but take peeks when I can. Even when I&rsquo;m peeking, move to cover the likely next threat.</li>
<li>better around breaks, flick hucks.</li>
</ul>

    <p>We lost 15-13. Just like las year. Just like two years before that. 15-13 is my least-favorite score. The thing is that we actually played pretty well this time too. I don&rsquo;t remember too many stupid decisions. But we did dig ourselves into a hole early on and could not climb back out of it. Mott and Quinn both played very well, skying pretty much everyone on PTA repeatedly. Isaac and Swilson talked a big game, but I was underwhelmed by their play (though Swilson was solid on D). Having Paul and Tache back was a plus, but Adam and Dustin were out with injuries. Maybe we&rsquo;ll get our shit together next year.</p>

    <p>First game of Mercer finals was a typical Roots finals game. We went up a few, couldn&rsquo;t close, and lost 19-18. We played well for the most part on both O and D. Our O line was especially strong in the second half, scoring most goals quickly and efficiently. Our D was solid, though we didn&rsquo;t get many takeaways. We also struggled to convert our Ds, sometimes having multiple-turn points where we had trouble getting downfield cuts. Noah was really big for us, as were Quinn and Mott. I had one turn on an IO break flick that went over my reciever&rsquo;s head. Otherwise I played decently well, though my D was not the best. I need to focus more on my guy and work on my footwork more.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Another awesome Wildwood is in the books. Random friends were seen, beach ultimate was played, beers were shotgunned, and we even a trophy. Here&rsquo;s how it went down.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>I started the weekend by fooling everyone into thinking that I&rsquo;m now the TD of wildwood. The crew asked me to send an email to every player at the tourney to tell them some useful info (be respectful, no glass on the beach, watch out for plainclothes cops, etc). But the way it came off, it was like I was making the announcement, and that&rsquo;s usually the TD&rsquo;s job. All weekend people came up to me asking about cops and saying they didn&rsquo;t know I was in charge of wildwood now. I set most of them straight, but sometimes it was easier to just go with it.</p>

<p>Friday was also the start of our weekend-long game of Gems. Everyone started with 5 gems, and whoever had the most by the end of the weekend got to keep the trophy. People were flipcupping for gems, betting gems (I won 3 on an arm wrestle between Diana and Katie), and even giving gems away for things. It definitely spiced the weekend up.</p>

<p>After pregaming at the house, we head for the Bolero. We danced for a bit, then bounced and went for ice cream and skinny-dipping in the ocean. The water was surprisingly warm, and the ice cream was surprisingly good - vanilla with strawberries on top. That sobered us up some, so we went home to party some more.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>Our theme for the weekend was a bit unusual: you must wear (at most) one article of clothing and it must cover your back. We had some interesting choices - dresses, panda suits, wrestling singlets, full-body spandex suits, even a kimono. I went with a fullbody suit on Saturday and a dress on Sunday. The suit was a big hit, and not all that bad to play in. I thought it would be super-hot (it was) and that throwing in those gloves would be tough (it wasn&rsquo;t). We spent most of the day drinking and chilling with people. We won all our games (both Troyalty and Troylettes) without too much of a struggle. One of the teams we played was solid, but we stepped our game up and won by 4, our closest win of the day.</p>

<p>The party was quite good this year, mostly because we didn&rsquo;t spend too much time at the Bolero. We pregamed at the house, then went out. Robb and I went ahead of the rest, and we went straight to the Rabs party room by the pool. When we migrated to the Bolero dancefloor, Diana was already there. We spent maybe 5 min inside, then went back to the Rabs room and to the pool area. After much socializing and big-containering and dice-gaming, our thoughts turned to food and we went to buy way more Chinese than we needed (though Singapore noodles were delicious). We ate on the steps near our house, then went in for the afterparty and for bedtime.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>Sunday went pretty similar to Saturday. The teams we played were better, but we were never down on points. Our two-pointers were decent, our guys were very solid, and our ladies carried the day as usual. I thought we&rsquo;d have trouble against Esser&rsquo;s team, but we went up big and they didn&rsquo;t manage to catch up in time. In the finals, we played Max Power, a Canadian team that played in Borocay and other beach tournaments. We talked them into playing Pick-6, which turned out great. I ran back a pick-6 for a goal, then threw a pick-6 Callahan shortly afterwards. Our first game to 7 was closer than it should have been. I threw a 2-pointer at 5-5 to win it, but it could have gone either way. Our second game was not as tight. I think we won 7-3 or 7-2. After the games, I played an awesome spirit game of 1-on-1 hockey in the sand. We each had a tiny hockey stick and the puck was a tennis ball. I lost my game, then Diana played one of their girls and lost as well. But we did drink tasty Canadian whiskey, so really everyone won.</p>

<p>Troylettes lost their second game on Sunday, so they were done at this point. There was nothing left to do but collect the trophy, take some photos, and then count our gems. We met back at the house and went through the final calculations. After much trading and consolidating, Stefan and I were the clear leaders. It was very close, and we each did some shots and promised some things to get the last few. We&rsquo;re now both wearing our costumes to FGiving, and I owe Steve a cheesesteak next time I&rsquo;m in Troy. In the end, I had two gems more than Stefan so I took home the MVP title and the trophy. I like to think of it as being voted &ldquo;most entertaining&rdquo; by the team.</p>

<p>Lessons for next year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gems game was great, but the small gems were annoying.</li>
<li>Prepare a spirit game. They are very fun.</li>
<li>Team theme for next year: fun police.</li>
<li>Robb should be in charge of swag.</li>

    <p>NY Invite. Haven&rsquo;t been to this tourney since 2009, when it rained insanely hard and the games did not get called off until after the fields were wrecked. Maybe they haven&rsquo;t been able to get the fields since&hellip;</p>

<p>I continued in my role as the primary O-line cutter. I think I played better this weekend. I only had 3 turnovers - two hit my receiver in the hands and one was a good look but a bit too low and too far for Benny to catch up to. I played fairly solid D after turns (and even got some D points in during the last game) but I think I could have done better. My favorite games were against Slow, Shuyamouf and CLX.</p>

<p>Lessons from the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>need to continue working on my throws, especially on putting enough snap on my flicks and on reaching out on my backhands.</li>
<li>am getting better with the shape of my cuts, but need to start deep cuts from closer in.</li>
<li>need to work on executing the proper dump cut. I went upline a good amount but did not come across for the IO at all.</li>
<li>pay more attention to the mental prep and the instructions from captains. they set the focus, but it&rsquo;s easy to forget what is said when you&rsquo;re focusing on the current point.</li>
</ul>


<p>My stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>35 O points, 8 D points</li>
<li>10 goals</li>
<li>4 assists</li>
<li>1 D</li>
<li>3 throwaways, 0 drops</li>

    <p>Played 3 days (Thurs-Sat) of high-level ultimate in the Twin Cities. It was like having an early Nationals. The top 6 teams from last year&rsquo;s nationals were here, as well as Union (Canada&rsquo;s national champion) and a mixed team from Colombia. I played almost exclusively O line, which is a first for me. I did not feel 100% comfortable all the time, especially with the effectiveness of my cutting and the number of turns I had. But everyone told me I played well and should be happy with how I did.</p>

<p>Overall it was great playing against such strong teams so early in the season. We played Drag'n Thrust and Wildcard to universe (and had the opportunity to win both) and won a universe-point game against Union. We also played decently against Polar Bears, though they beat us 15-9. After games, we had a great time hanging out, partying and exploring with the team. Much bonding was accomplished.</p>

<p>My stats for the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>39 O points, 7 D points</li>
<li>8 goals</li>
<li>7 assists</li>
<li>3 Ds</li>
<li>7 throwaways, 2 drops</li>

    <p>Scrimmage at the Duck Pond. We played 4 games of 10-12 minutes. All games were 5v5 and on-the-fly subbing, but on a full field. We also added the rule that you cannot throw backwards. I played well for the most part, but had a poor flick huck again. I did have several good hucks though. I&rsquo;ll keep working on it.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I ran the 10cut drill 5 times. I focused on figuring out my footwork, getting low on turns, and running at top speed the whole time.</p>

<p>The squad is pretty stacked this year. The Sauls, Bode and Quinn are back in town, Dundala and Pauly are back from hiatus, and a few of the younger guys are looking pretty strong. As long as we don&rsquo;t choke when the pressure&rsquo;s on, we should be in good shape.</p>

    <p>A few AMP guys and friends of the team scrimmaged the Haverford mens' team. We played a game to 6 first (which we won 6-2), then played about 6 or 7 points of zone against them to give them more practice. Finally, we mixed up the teams and scrimmaged for half an hour or so. We didn&rsquo;t have many subs, so I got to play a lot. Haverford has several players who are very strong, but they didn&rsquo;t move the disc too well and relied on being taller and more athletic.</p>

    <h2>Ultisquash</h2>

<p>The veteran&rsquo;s ultisquash fight club committee decided to honor Diana and me by inviting us to their elite game. In attendance: Wheels, Schmucker, TC, Panna, Dre, Raha, us. We played a dozen or so games, all intense and fast-paced. I really enjoyed playing with Schmucker and Wheels. They don&rsquo;t come out much and I don&rsquo;t get to play with them that often. Also covering TC was a lot of fun. What a great way to end the season.</p>

<h2>Spinners Practice</h2>

<p>I was rather sore after all that ultisquashing, but decided to go to Spinners practice anyway. The weather was finally nice and it&rsquo;s good to get my outdoor throws straight as early as possible. We spent a good amount of time on drills and working on some set plays, then scrimmaged a lot. We started our first set of scrimmages with a hunger-drill throw to simulate playing after a huck. I&rsquo;ve never done that before but I really like it. We also played a bunch of 2-minute make-it-take-it games and worked on double-teaming.</p>

<p>I was really tired by the time we started scrimmaging, and it didn&rsquo;t help that we had very few subs. I thought I played reasonably well and had some good throws and cuts, though I dropped the disc TWICE during the 4 lines cutting drill (where we were specifically trying not to drop the disc by focusing on catching one point of it) and also turfed an easy throw to DBaer because I didn&rsquo;t pivot.</p>

    <p>Last regular-season game, and it&rsquo;s against the 1 seed. They didn&rsquo;t play like they&rsquo;re the best team in the league, but they did beat us by 10 or so and they are solid all around. We played pretty well, and having Leo really helps. He&rsquo;s a great thrower and he knows when to cut deep. If only we&rsquo;d had Tom, Ashley and Ashley, we could have had a really close game.</p>

    <p>Beat Trey&rsquo;s team by 1 point in an exciting back-and-forth indoor game. We finally had our whole team. They were missing Trey, but had everyone else. They played the Trey zone with TC as the big man deep, but we were disciplined enough to work through it most of the time. We also played well on D and got a decent number of blocks on dumps to TC. He played really well and did almost everything for them. But in the end, Ashley put up a full-field buzz beater to Tom to win it.</p>

    <p>3 days of gorgeous weather, high-level ultimate and awesome partying &hellip; or at least that&rsquo;s the pitch. Unfortunately, this year did not live up to expectations.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>The weather on Saturday was not bad. It wasn&rsquo;t sunny, but at least there was no wind and the ground was fairly dry. We played 3 teams - Maui Mana (a local team), Colony (an Australian club team preparing for worlds), and Club Prince (a Madcow-Bravo combo team). All the games were lopsided. We crushed Maui and got our ass kicked by the other two. The game against Prince was a bit closer than the other, but the finals score was 15-7 or so. We didn&rsquo;t play great.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>The weather got worse on Sunday. There was a lot of rain and the ground was very muddy by the time we played (11:45am start times today and yesterday). We played another local team and wrecked them, then played KUT (Carleton Alum) and got killed again. I skipped the second half of the first game and the first half of the second game to pick up with Ski Patrol, which made my day much more interesting. They were mostly Seattle guys with a few outside pickups (Brown, Zargham, Lucas). They play a very different style of ultimate - much more relaxed and dynamic, but still focused. I wish I&rsquo;d had more time to play with them. I did get to play half a game aginst Sofia Freaks, another unique and interesting team that I love playing against. They went up in the first half and took half 8-4. After I left, Ski Patrol rallied and won the game on universe point.</p>

<p>After pool play ended, we played a prequarter game against Stanford Bloodthirsty. The game was close the whole way, with them leading by a bit, but we got a late break and won 13-12 when the game got capped. Stanford had a great deep game and their primary handlers played very well. We sucked on D and were decent on O. Everything was pretty sloppy. We also had a 15 min break when one of the Stanford guys hurt himself. In the end, the game got capped and we scored on O to win it.</p>

<h2>Monday</h2>

<p>Winning in prequarters earned us the right to play Ono in quarters. By this point, the fields were completely torn up and muddy. The wind made the game almost unplayable (it blew over the tournament tent early that morning) and most of us had trouble throwing and catching. Ono had several strong throwers, and they were able to convert several upwind breaks, which quickly lead to downwind breaks. It was shitty all around and we lost 15-6 or so.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overall I played very well for the first two days. Ignoring the Ono game (it was terrible ultimate), I had no throwing turnovers and just one drop  - a throw from Bhavin in the endzone that should have been an easy catch but I misread it a bit and then dropped the catch. I mostly cut, but did some handling and played a bunch of defense. I&rsquo;m especially happy with my offense. Maybe playing O line for Amp is a good move.</p>

    <p>3 hours of Phoenix tryouts at Maple Zone. We spent most of the time doing drills. The first few drills were pretty cool - 4 stations, each with a different set of cuts, and you run the cuts as fast as you can. There was a straight 40, a 10yard incut followed by a 40 deep, and two drills with 2 short cuts each. We ran each set of cuts once and were timed.</p>

<p>After the cuts, we had 4 more stations to rotate through:</p>

<ul>
<li>baseball drill</li>
<li>defense drill (defending an incut, break cut and deep cut, then later defending the dump)</li>
<li>breakmark drill, then continuation cutting drill</li>
<li>marking drill</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally at the end we got to scrimmage two games to 7. I wish we had played more, but it was still fun.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Lots of utlimate tonight: core winter league at Ampro, then Spinners practice at Tee&rsquo;s. I got lucky and found rides from/to everything.</p>

<h2>Winter League</h2>

<p>We played a great game tonight and pulled off a strong win against a (possibly) better team. We stuck to our goals (don&rsquo;t get beat to the force-side cone, always have a dump), played great defense and smart offense. We got out to an early lead and held it the whole game, never letting them come within 3 points. Thanasis and Eddie had a great game, coming up with some nice Ds and some big skies. Our ladies also did well on offense, and their defense is improving each game.</p>

<p>To be fair, Jake&rsquo;s team was missing Jack Kelly and Jake was not at 100% because he&rsquo;s just coming back from a long hamstring injury recovery. But I still think we played our best game yet and the improvement is very encouraging. I did not expect us to win a single game this season and had switched focus to coaching and working on fundamentals. But maybe that&rsquo;s the secret?</p>

<h2>Spinners Practice</h2>

<p>After our game, Jake and I went to the practice. We did a short warmup, some 3-man handler weaveing, a drill to work on our first step, and then some scrimmaging. We mostly worked on dumps to the open side (and dump defense). We also played 2-minute segments with no subs, alternating 5v5 and 4v4. Finally, we played a few 5-minute quarters with subs.</p>

<p>I felt pretty good throughout the practice. It was really cold at Tee&rsquo;s and my hands were freezing, so my throws were not as quick or accurate as usual. But the main thing that&rsquo;s holding me back right now is fitness. I gotta in better shape. Also, better footwork would be great. Ben&rsquo;s first-step drills should be helpful here.</p>
