    <p>We won the finals of indoor spring league 36-34. That score is pretty deceptive though. In the first half, we opened up a huge lead. I think we were up by more than 10 points at one time. Then in the third quarter, we stopped playing <em>nice and easy</em> and they started scoring 2 for every 1 we put in. In the fourth, they went on a run, scoring 4 or 5 breaks in a row to bring the score within three. We called a timeout, regrouped, and got back to the nice and easy mentality. We held our lead to close out the game.</p>

    <p>Had a double-length practice today. We had over 40 people there. Did a bunch of drills for marking (esp straight-up) and breaking the mark. We also worked on a sequence for getting the disk off the sideline. We scrimmaged for about 3 hours total, which was awesome. After practice, we went to Percy Street BBQ for some delicious brisket and beer.</p>

    <p>A day full of ultimate. In the morning, Justin and I played a hat tourney at Edgely. Team &ldquo;Favorite Nonalcoholic Beverage&rdquo; played three games. The first two were close but not that serious (we won the first, lost the second). The last game was against Dre and Billy&rsquo;s team, which got me really fired up to win. We didn&rsquo;t play well at first, but went on a strong 5-point run to take half. We held our lead through the second half (though they narrowed the gap) but gave up two breaks on universe point to lose the game. Most of our team was pretty young, but we also had a few more experienced players. It was a great mix and we had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>After the games, Justin, Maddie and I hit up Chipotle and then swung by Sedgely for a bit of disc golf. We met Panna and Billy at hole 3 and played till the 9th hole. Then Anna picked me up and we headed off to indoor spring league.</p>

<p>We had a double header against Dre&rsquo;s team and then Butter&rsquo;s team. The first game was close for the whole game, but in the 4th quarter we made a concerted effort to move the disc quickly and not try to huck it, which helped us score a few quick breaks in a row and win the game 37-31. The second game was tougher, with us trailing by 1 for most of the game. We took the lead sometimes, but we were pretty tired and didn&rsquo;t have enough discipline to pull out the win. They won 31-30, handing us our first loss of the season.</p>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m really sore.</p>

    <p>Played two days of indoor at the Indoor Nationals. The whole thing was not very well organized and the fields were crappy (they were square) but it was still fun to play. We played well on Saturday but lost by 1 to a not-very-strong team. We still ended up winning our pool on point diff. Sunday, we beat Boston (the eventual winner) and made it as far as semis, but then lost in the semis to a team from DC. Our defense was good throughout the weekend, but our offense was disorganized at times and gave up too many turns. I&rsquo;m not really sure what the cause was - square fields, lack of playing together, strong opponents? Either way, there&rsquo;s more to work on for the future.</p>

<p>After playing 4 games on Sat and 4 on Sunday, I went to our first indoor spring league games Sunday night. We won both and played pretty well, but again took too many ill-advised throws on offense. But I&rsquo;m excited for spring league. Our team is fun and solid, and the seasson (which is 1/3rd over) promises to be a fun one.</p>

    <p>Fools was a blast, as usual. I spent most of my time playing and partying with ShortFatGuys (mostly DoG players + Wiggins and Idaho + some younger guys from NYC and Rochester + DanD, Dana and myself), but I picked up with Penn and the GodFeathers for a few games. I think I played 11 games over 3 days. Most were foolish, but several were really intense - we had two games against Plonkers (aka Ring) and one against UVA alums (Truck Stop) that we managed to win.</p>

<p>Takeaways from the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>I cut too close to the handlers. Need to clear earlier.</li>
<li>I have to stop clearing up the sideline and clear to the front of the stack.</li>
<li>When chasing a deep cut on D, spend less time looking for the disc and more time chasing. Otherwise I won&rsquo;t catch up.</li>
<li>My backhand dumps suck. Need to step out and reach farther.</li>
<li>Zone defense: commit early. Don&rsquo;t get stuck between two players, pick one and go.</li>
<li><strong>Team defense</strong>. We don&rsquo;t play enough of that in Philly.</li>

    <p>Picked up with Butter&rsquo;s core team for a game against Dallas. We went up early and didn&rsquo;t take it very seriously, but then they came back and won by 1 or 2. It was a very fun game even though we didn&rsquo;t win - very spirited and pretty high level.</p>

<p>After that, we played our 3rd place game against Butter&rsquo;s full team. His full team was also missing a lot of players, so most of them were pickups and the whole game felt like a high-level pickup game (I spent a quarter playing tag with Marin instead of playing the game). We ended up winning by a lot.</p>

We still made semis though. In semis, we beat Scorpio (BLo&rsquo;s team and probably the favorite to win it). Then in the finals, we had a rematch against Tad&rsquo;s team and beat them by 2 points to win the whole thing. Tad&rsquo;s team ended up beating BLo in the backdoor finals to take the second bid to nationals.</p>

    <p>We played the winter league season opener against Butter&rsquo;s team. We played OK in the first half, they played better. In the second half, we really started to suck. Our team is pretty tall, so the deep game should have been good, but we overthrew our receivers 3 out of 4 times (or maybe more) while our in-cuts were wide open. Our defense was also lacking. Overall, a poor showing. We lost 27-14 after being down 14-10 at half.</p>

<p>I think our team has a lot of potential. I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re the tallest team in the leage, and we definitely have the best women. We just have to reign in the deep shots (or start to aim at the front of the endzone) and step our D up, and we&rsquo;ll be crushing it. I&rsquo;m missing our next five games unless I reschedule a few, but hopefully things come together in my absence.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played indoor at Tee&rsquo;s with a bunch of AMP players and some friends. We put in a solid 2 hours of scrimmaging. I relearned for the millionth time that I&rsquo;m much better at getting blocks than throwing goals (or even passes). After scrimmage, we raged at the Furfs' house and then swung by Noah&rsquo;s housewarming party. A grand time was had by all.</p>

    <p>A short pre-finals workout. All we did was go through our usual warmup (jog a lap, dynamic warmup, Omega (breakmark) drill, Santa Cruz drill, Santa Cruz with in-cuts from the outside to the middle). Then we went inside and watched our game against Indy to prepare for Saturday.</p>
