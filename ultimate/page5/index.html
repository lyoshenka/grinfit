    <p>Played the first game with my high schooler team. We worked on setting goals that are within our control: always having a dump and not getting beat to the force-side cone. For the first half, we didn&rsquo;t have those explicit goals and we played pretty poorly. After half, our focus improved and we matched Gooch&rsquo;s team point for point. But we didn&rsquo;t really convert any breaks and they rode their first-half lead to the win.</p>

<p>I ended up staying to watch the second game and throw with Cuatro. Then it turned out that Norm&rsquo;s team was shorthanded, so I picked up with them for my second game. They are a more experienced and disciplined team, so our game was a lot closer. Fern played especially well for us. But Drexel put together an athletic team and pulled away in the second half to secure their victory. Two losses in one night.</p>

    <p>An awesome weekend of Leiing Out. All our games were really close - don&rsquo;t think we won any by more than 3. Our team was solid, though some people played uncharacteristically poorly. Charlie Mercer carried the team for the most part. I played alright. My throws/O/D were solid, but some decisions were poor and I missed a few plays on mental errors.</p>

<p>The parties were sweet. Some things I remember:</p>

<h2>AMP Indoor</h2>

<p>Played more amp. We spent more time focusing on cutting. Did a new drill where one cutter cuts in, catches the disc, and hits a second in-cut at an exact location. The goal is for the second cutter to time their cut so they get the disc i nstride at the correct spot. We also scrimmaged a lot.</p>

<p>Played a bunch of ultisquash in the morning. We hav enough people for two games, so we played pretty much nonstop. I was undefeated until the very last game.</p>

<h2>Amp Indoor</h2>

<p>Another great indoor session. We spent more time working on downfield cutting. One thing we did was eliminate the dump in several drills. We also worked on cutter timing and some short 3 on 3 drills. We finished with a bunch of scrimmages, throwing, rolling and dinner at Butter&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>My indoor throws have definitely been improving. Fitness is still a bit lacking, though that may be because of the ultisquash.</p>

    <p>An awesome 2 hours. We did some short stretches and drills, then scrimmaged a lot. First drill was a give-and-go drill with 3 stationary receivers and one cutter running down the middle of the field. I liked the drill, but I&rsquo;m unsure about the in-game usefulness. Going from catch to throw quickly was good practice. But when I try to do this move in a real game, the hardest part is throwing to a moving cutter while also moving.</p>

<p>After that drill and a 1-on-1 cutting in space drill, we played a bunch of scrimmages. For the first few, we were not allowed to throw the disc backwards. For the last few, it was just standard indoor ultimate with a slightly longer stall count.</p>

<p>I need to match up against Papa more.</p>

    <p>Played a few fun games at SJ&rsquo;s indoor hat tourney. My team was a bit stacked because I was a maybe and the team was meant to be decent even without me. But we ended up very strong, with several good club guys and some strong ladies too. We won our first two games pretty easily, then played a close game against Trey&rsquo;s team where we were down the whole time but came back at the end to win 14-12. In the finals, we played against another stacked team from the B pool: Billy Maroon, Izzy, a few tall dudes and some ladies that knew how to get open in the endzone. We trailed the whole time again, but closed the gap at the end. We lost by only 2 points.</p>

<p>A lot of people from the previous weekend&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s tourney came back out for this. It was fun to play with some of the guys I played against the last time.</p>

    <p>Played a really fun and really high-level indoor tournament at MapleZone. There were 5 teams of about equal caliber:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rabs + Trey</li>
<li>Heva Havas + Roots</li>
<li>Med Men + Mazur</li>
<li>Spank</li>
<li>Amp + Hypnotoad + UDel + Termites (us)</li>
</ul>


<p>About a third of the team was from our Entrapment indoor nationals crew (me, Chappers, Ducky, Weez, and Keg), and I&rsquo;d played with many of the guys on Amp, but the UDel guys (Charles and Brian) were new to me. They both played well, each with at least one really nice sky. Josh also had some amazing moments, including breaking through a secret door in the endzone after a big sky. But despite the uncomfortable amounts of FUN we were having, we only went 1-3.</p>

<p>Despite our record, I&rsquo;m very happy with the weekend. All the teams were very evenly matched and we lost our games by 3 points or less. The team we beat went on to lose in the finals against Trabs. 3 teams were tied 2-2 and had the exact same point diff.</p>

<p>Oh yea. We had a hawk disc. We scored at least one goal with it, after which the other team made us swap the disc out. They lost. Don&rsquo;t mess with the hawk. Just hawk it!</p>

    <p>Played against Dre&rsquo;s team and Satell&rsquo;s team. I&rsquo;m becoming more convinced that a team playing their second game back-to-back is better off than their opponents who are on their first game (assuming the double header team has good numbers). We lost to Dre&rsquo;s team by 2 and beat Satell&rsquo;s team by 2, though we were up 6 on Satell in the 4th quarter and started to get lazy. Dre&rsquo;s team played well and did a great job poaching against us. Satell&rsquo;s team was on their first game of the season (we were on our 3rd), so that may have had something to do with their loss, but they also lacked strong women to match their very strong men. I think they&rsquo;ll get better as the season goes on.</p>

    <p>Fall league against the Penn State team (again). They were savage, we had 1 sub of each gender. We warmed up with Spikeball, then started playing. We took half 8-4 without feeling any real pressure. After half, they came zone. It was a bit windy, but mostly it was cold, and our throws were off. We let them score 5 breaks straight before we get our shit together and started playing like a real team. I think we won the game 15-11 or maybe 15-12. Finished with some more Spikeball before the lights went out.</p>

    <p>Had a fairly light practice. We worked on several play calls, did a few pull play scrimmages and some transition work, worked on our redzone O and our marks, scrimmaged and threw deep in the wind. I played with the O line again so I&rsquo;ll be ready to fill in on O when needed. I had some unusually bad turns on O, including a drop on a wide-open pass. D was better - definitely feeling faster after the last two weeks of easier and more consistent workouts. Looking forward to one last high-intensity workout on Monday or Tuesday to seal the deal.</p>

    <p>Good practice. I played with the O line this time, which was a nice change for me. I think I did well overall. My spacing and timing wasn&rsquo;t as great as it could have been, and I threw my only turn of the day on a wide-open cut to Alex. I put too much edge on the disc and it dropped right at his feet. I also did well in the redzone scrimmge and the upline drill. On D, I played tight on my guy but got beat deep once or twice and wasn&rsquo;t as decisive in the zone as I should have been (pick one side and commit, don&rsquo;t hang out in the middle).</p>
