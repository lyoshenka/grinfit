    <p>Another indoor double header. Won our first game handily, then eked out a last-second win on universe in the finals. Zoya came again. She&rsquo;s
getting a lot of ultimate-watching in. Hope it rubs off on her (just the good stuff though).</p>

    <p>Another year, another nationals. This year it was back in Sarasota. The weather was hot, but the location is the best - the fields were
beautiful, the ocean was amazing (even at night, and even despite the jellyfish), and the Daquiri Deck was even better than I remember it.
The only thing lacking was our game. We lost all our games on Thursday (9-12 Blackbird, 11-12 AMP, 11-12 Toro), then won the next 4 games
and clawed our way back into the top 8 before losing the 7/8 game to Drag'n Thrust (13-10 Love Tractor, 14-11 Steamboat, 12-11 Blackbird,
15-9 shame, 9-15 Drag'n). So, no finals appearance this year, but we did win the spirit award, which is almost as big.</p>

<p>Personally I played fairly well. I was only in 2-4 points a game, so I was fresh overall. I had 3 turns total - a drop against AMP and two
throwaways on hucks. Both were good decisions, decently well-thrown, and just a little off the mark. We talked about taking calculated
risks, so I stand by them. I scored 5 goals, threw one, and got a D. I felt I could have contributed more, esp filling in as an O line
cutter when our O was tired (like the last game on Thurs), but we ran a fairly tight rotation so I did my best to help from the sideline.</p>

<p>Another nationals highlight was watching AMP make it to the finals for the first time ever. They played really well, but ended up losing on
universe to Mixtape in a very exciting game. Despite that, I&rsquo;m really happy for them. Their team is very young and they&rsquo;ll be strong for a
few years at least (if they stick together).</p>

<p>Finally, the best part (as always) is spending time with people you know and like. I had a great time bonding with the team (chai time,
skinny dipping every night, getting kicked off the beach at 4am, dirty dancing at the Daquiri Deck, spikeball vs Truck/Scandal) as well as
people I don&rsquo;t get to see that often (again at the Deck, and at the fields, and the beach, and random places in between).</p>

<p>Hope to do it all again next year.</p>

stranger danger, all smiles and giggles. Our team crushed the other team, who was on the second game of their double-header and didn&rsquo;t have
many subs. Afterwards, we went out to lunch.</p>

    <p>We came, we saw, we conquered (except for Slow). We started the weekend off in classic Metro North fashion: by ignoring everything we
practice and jamming it in the jamhole repeatedly. But we eventually got our shit together, moved the disc well, and raised our game. The
crossover with Slow was an epic back-and-forth game, and we even got the D on the goal line on universe and had the opportunity to win it,
but a nice D by Todd got them the disc back and they converted for the win. On Sunday, we had a really close game with Xist - another
universe-point game, but this time we won it and qualified for Nationals. We played Slow again in the finals, but it was just for seeding
and half our team sat the game out.</p>

<p>Peronally, my main errors were on hucks. When I&rsquo;m rushing my huck or I feel like I have to throw it (when we call Sausage), it never goes
well. When I&rsquo;m throwing in a power position or it feels natural, I&rsquo;m great. Besides that, my game was great - solid defense (including
several points where not only did my guy never touch the disc, but I felt like he was never open at all), strong cutting, and consistently
moving the disc to the breakside. My only turns were 3 hucks, and only one of them was a bad decision. I even felt strong and fast all
weekend, never feeling like I cannot keep up with my defender or cannot keep cutting well.</p>

    <p>A weekend in Boston with Metro North 2017. I&rsquo;m in the worst shape ever going into a season, with several nagging injuries. Despite that, I
still played pretty well. My two turns were both poor-decision, poor-execution hucks. I also had some mistakes on D, getting beat badly a
few times. On the upside, I had 3 Ds including a fall-over handblock on the mark, I threw some nice throws and hucks, and my legs felt ok at
the end of Sunday. Even running the nine 40s at the end (one for each OB pull all weekend) felt pretty good.</p>

    <p>An exciting weekend for Metro North. We won the region, beating Slow White (the top seed, and #2 in the country) 15-13 in the finals. That
game was one of the cleanest and most focused games I&rsquo;ve ever played. Our O line only had two turns, and only let Slow convert one of them.
Our D line converted two breaks (I caught both of them :-) ), and had a chance to convert at least one more. I felt like I was completely
in the zone and focused on the game. I did talk to people on the sideline, but I barely remember what I said.</p>

<p>Before the finals, we had a few close games with 7X and Wildcard. I played fairly well in those too, though I had one or two turns on Sat
and missed some D opportunities.</p>

    <p>6 games across 2 days. We didn&rsquo;t have many players, and lost some to injury as the weekend went on, so I got a lot of reps. I tried out KT
tape for my knee, and am happy to report that it did not bother me at all on Saturday and only hurt a little on Sunday (whether this
correlation implies any causation or not, I still don&rsquo;t know). I had more turns and less Ds this weekend than I did in Colorado, but I also
had to handle more since Lucas wasn&rsquo;t there and Liz is out for the season. I esp played poorly against Amp and Drag'n Thrust, with several
turns in each game that were caused by rushing a throw - my main problem area. If we converted just a few more breaks, we could have won
those games (or at least kept them competitive).</p>

<p>I threw the longest huck for a goal of my life - an 80-yard endzone-to-endzone huck to Mari. To be fair my mark was slow to get set so I had
a wide-open backhand, but it&rsquo;s still a nice achievement.</p>

<ul>
<li>Darts and credit card roulette for spin-the-wheel on Friday = 4 hours of sleep</li>
<li>First point of Saturday - we have 4 players there on time</li>
<li>Pool(tub) of shame</li>
<li>Gooch wears a $90 shark wrestling singlet</li>
<li>Games got rained out around noon on Sat</li>
<li>Circling the wagons, playing dice and drinking, car-swapping relay races</li>
<li>Front seat must be naked</li>
<li>Day drinking and pizza box at Mike&rsquo;s</li>
<li>No one is allowed to take off clothes when they shower</li>
<li>Dinner with Seth &amp; Jennie</li>
<li>Anti-thumper at Wolff&rsquo;s</li>
<li>After-party at Liz&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house</li>
<li>First game on sunday - opponents warm up for half an hour, we win 13-4</li>
<li>Tom Kirby&rsquo;s 15-year-old son Jack picks up with us for the day. He&rsquo;s pretty good for being 15.</li>
<li>Second game - we fall behind pretty hard, rally the troups, eke out a win</li>
<li>I throw Dana a terrible floaty huck, do my penance by drinking a sip from the pool of shame</li>
<li>Squirt-gun shootout with a 4-year-old</li>
<li>Semis - game is very upwind/downwind, we can&rsquo;t catch a disc in the endzone to save our lives, lose 13-9</li>
<li>Last point of semis: I catch a nice half-field throw from Brown, dish it, drop the next pass. Handler picks up, I handblock his hammer,
cut to the endzone. Brown throws to my S-cut, it gets Ded, I lay out a million feet to catch it. Rush to stand up and throw the goal, get
footblocked. About 30 seconds of my highest highs and lowest lows for the day.</li>
<li>I threw and caught at least 1 Rochester each</li>
<li>Post-tourney burgers at Jumping Jacks, grilling at Liz&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s, home by 8pm</li>

    <p>6 games over 3 days at the US Open. We did really well, winning our pool (despite a last-game loss to Polar Bears) and then losing a close
game to Slow in the semis. Personally, I wasn&rsquo;t at the top of my game because my toe was killing me, but it actually got better throughout
the weekend and I played my best game against Slow. I even got a shoutout after games on Saturday for continuing to cut hard even late in
the day/tournament.</p>

<p>Besides the ultimate, I had a lot of fun hanging out with the team. We drank beer, went swimming in the ocean, played games, watched
ultimate, and enjoyed each others company. It was a great start to the season.</p>

    <p>Two long, hot days of ultimate with not many subs. The D line guys were practically savage all weekend, especially Saturday. DJ left halfway
into the second game, so the four of us (Lucas, Billy YoungJo, and I) played every D point after that. Occaisionally one or two others would
sub in and help out, but that was basically it. On top of that, I did a bad job taking care of myself (not enough water, salt and sunblock, not
enough sleep and food the day before). In one of the very last points of the fourth game, I cramped up super-hard (both hamstrings and a
calf) and had to lie on the ground for 10 min before I could get up again. Thankfully the game ended and we were done for the day.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I took extra care to eat and drink a lot (I also ice-showered the night before), and felt way better. We were still low on
numbers, but DJ returned and John G&rsquo;s hamstring felt better so he played a few points. Despite playing the whole previous day, I felt less
tired after Sunday than I did after Saturday. The caffeine and electrolyte pills probably helped too.</p>

<p>Game-wise, I guess I played well. I&rsquo;m not happy about my lack of forced Ds and how tired I felt, but its hard to compare that to a normal
game where I&rsquo;ll have proper subs. I didn&rsquo;t throw many turnovers, which is great for me, but I did make several fatigue-induced mistakes (not
helping out on a few discs, getting beat upline, dropping two discs that I had my hands on, some throwaways). Then again, I played solid
defense the vast majority of the time. Even in the last game, I stuck close to my guy a lot and ran a few nice switches with Billy. I guess
my main problem was summoning the will to cut hard after a turn, esp late in the day. On the points where I forced myself to go hard, we
usually did well and scored quickly. On the points where I was too tired, it was hard to make things happen. I gained a lot of respect for
the other guys on the line (esp Billy) and their nonstop effort after turns.</p>

<p>I picked up a few minor injuries (a bruise under my big toe nail, some soreness in my tendons), but my tendonitis doesnt seem to be
bothering me today. I hope it still feels good after US Open next week, and continues to hold throughout the season.</p>

    <p>7 games across 2 days at Windmill. Played the Portuguese and Polish
nationals teams, club teams from all over Europe, a team from Israel, and
one US-ish pickup team. We were very solid for a pickup team, but were
inconsistent and plagued with injuries. Finished 17th with a 4-4 record - a
lot of close losses and hard-fought games.</p>

<p>Personal highlights include a big layout D, several nice hucks, solid
handling and cutting all around, and some good lessons learned about
leadership (mostly: if the team expects you to lead, you have to lead. Even
if you like to keep it loose, you are in charge and need to provide
direction)</p>

<p>The best part of windmill is, or course, the people. Our whole team was
talented, extremely friendly and nice. The Portuguese team was awesome (my
fav game, I think) and I saw a bunch of BDP friends. I also made some new
friends that I hope to see again sometime. Maybe windmill &lsquo;17?</p>

    <p>Played a fun hat tournament run by Slow White. It was great to play with some people that I only get to play against (Miller, Ralph, Davis,
etc). The level of play was reasonaly high, but there were some newer players (league and college players), so it was more fun than intense.
Still, it was a great workout. I got to handle a good amount and cover some great players. Plus our team won the whole thing and got a
last-round bye. What more could you ask for?</p>

    <p>Tryouts went 3-6pm Saturday and then 9am-noon on Sunday. The format was mostly this: warm up, a bit of cutting/throwing drills, 3v3 mini,
4v4 full-field, 7v7 full-field. I had a lot of fun both days, playing against good players and being outside. The weather was a bit cold and
rainy today, but it really was not a problem.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel a bit more tired that I should (and felt somewhat more tired throughout the weekend then I think I should). I&rsquo;m chalking
it up to early-seasonness, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt this way in previous seasons (even last season, when I took 5 weeks off in
April-May). However, my flick hucks were pretty good for most of the weekend (only had one mistake), my breaks were solid, and my D was good
for the most part. I had a lot of trouble with Korber and Match, but did a good job on just about everyone else. My main problem was my
backhand hucks (I&rsquo;m 0-for-2) and timidness in the air (got skied a few times when I shouldn&rsquo;t have). My I/O flick was also a bit shitty at
times during mini, but that&rsquo;s probably due to fatigue for the most part.</p>

    <p>Two days of semi-serious ultimate in tiger costumes. Calvinball was a prety stacked team, but we managed to play quite poorly. We lost some
games we shouldn&rsquo;t have (including one on universe after being up 8-2 at half), we failed to take advantage of our 2-pointer rule, and we
were overall not very focused. But that&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s fools fest. Personally I tried not to play much, and I was mostly happy with how that
went. I got a layout D on a hammer, caught a two-pointer, caught a Callahan on a scoober dump, and only had a few turnovers. It was quite
windy, especially on Sunday, but even my &ldquo;start-on-O-upwind&rdquo; strategy failed to backfire :-).</p>

    <p>Played an hour of indoor with the Colt guys and Baywatch girls. We were pretty low on numbers and we were playing make-it-drop-it, so by the
end we were pretty dead. It was still fun, and I&rsquo;d do it again.</p>

    <p>Record low attendance (4 guys, 6 girls) meant lots of PT for me. I was extra tired by the time we finished. Maybe its the two tough games
yesterday, maybe its the focus on lifting over the past few months. Either way, time to take a day off tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Two solid indoor games. The first was against UConn (Liz/Saipher/Mary/others). We didn&rsquo;t play well (start off down 5-1) and the game was
quite chippy overall. We eventually clawed our way into the game, switched to backhand to prevent their easy hammer scores, and went up a
few points at the end. As time was running out, we buckled down and closed it out to win by 2.</p>

<p>The second game was the best game of the season. We played Colt/Baywatch. They were the favorite, with lots of solid club guys and
a deep roster. They only had two women, and we tried to take advantage of that, but I think it was pretty even. The whole game was very
close and very spirited. We forced middle the whole game (props to Bosco for the brilliant idea) and made sure we were subbing super fast.
We even created two subbing groups for the second half to make sure our lines were well-balanced.</p>

<p>I think the force middle really got to them, because their offence (normally very fast-paced and trigger-happy) slowed down a lot. We often
forced them to throw 20 or even 30 throws before they could score. Big props to the improved defense from everyone. On offense, Shockey
dominated. He probably scored half our goals that game. Bosco started throwing him floaty dimeballs, and eventually I found my stride and hit
him on a few nice hucks too. I think he only got beat in the air once.</p>

<p>When time ran out in the second half, the score was 20-20. They had just scored, so we decided it would be a universe-point game with us on
offense. We subbed in our best line and started working the disc. After 3 throws, Bosco unleashes a floaty hammer to CJ for the win. It
floats a bit too long, and gets D-ed toward me. I catch it and throw CJ game-winner. A very exciting end to a very good game.</p>

<h3>Team Wins</h3>

<ul>
<li>Force middle. Damn smart.</li>
<li>We finally subbed at the right pace. I&rsquo;m just as guilty of staying on too long as anyone. I&rsquo;m happy we finally did it right.</li>
<li>Great execution on the force middle. Sideline presence was strong and got everyone into the game. Several people had never played FM
before, but they did a great job figuring it out and implementing it. I&rsquo;d say this was the biggest factor in our win.</li>
<li>Strong deep game from Andy/Shockey. Really kept us in the game.</li>
<li>Excellent spirit from both teams.</li>
<li>Free beer for us after the game.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal Wins</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reeled in my bad throws from the first game, threw better deep looks in the second game.</li>
<li>D was on point. Got a nice layout D on Timmer in the endzone, an almost-handblock, and generally played my guy tight (plus ran some nice switches).</li>
<li>Biggest win was the last point. Not that I saved the hammer or threw the goal, but that I made myself get in position to clean up the
trash. When I&rsquo;m tired, I take mental shortcuts and just hope that things will work out. I clearly remember thinking &ldquo;oh, I don&rsquo;t need to
back CJ up. either he&rsquo;ll catch it or its a D&rdquo;. And my next thought was &ldquo;well, I can get close enough for a small chance at a second
attempt&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened, and it won us the game. This mental weakness has been a point of internal struggle for a
while, and I won that struggle today.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Needs Improvement</h3>

<ul>
<li>Still too risky/inconsistent with my deep throws.</li>
<li>Need to learn to better recognize when someone is open or not. I&rsquo;ve been hesitant on some throws to open players, when I should be hitting
them.</li>
<li>Starting giving-and-going towards the end, but still not natural.</li>
</ul>
