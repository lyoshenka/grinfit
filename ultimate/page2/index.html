    <p>1.5 hours of metro north indoor. Only had 5 guys, so I got to play a lot.</p>

<p>Feedback: my decisions are good in general, but sometimes I do something stupid. Diana called it my &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see&rdquo; throws.</p>

My highlights: got bunch of nice Ds, esp in the second game. Also completed
two skipsies for goals (out of three attempts). Lowlights: still more turns
than I&rsquo;d like (esp first game) and some weak defense at times. I also could
have been more aggressive as a cutter throughout.</p>

    <p>Started our first game with only 3 people. Had to pick up some friends for
the first half, until reinforcements arrived. Ended up losing by a couple.
Second game was closer and more intense. We won in OT after they had the
disc to win bun turned it over.</p>

<p>In general, I thought we played pretty poorly (probably not a popular
sentiment). Lots of high risk throws and turnovers. Some of the risky stuff
worked (Including the winning throw of the last game), but it&rsquo;s not a
sustainable way of playing.</p>

    <p>Another strong finish by the Rockford Peaches in fall league, though we played quite poorly in our second game. The guys didn&rsquo;t have many
subs, so our rotation was pretty tight. Our decision-making got really bad in the second game, especially towards the end. There was a
10-minute stretch right out of half where neither team scored a goal. We even called a timeout to talk about reining in our throws and going
for the easy ones, but then kept making bad choices even after that. In the end, we did manage to turn down the aggresiveness and score some
easy, patient goals. It also helped that the other team was missing Bosco, their best player.</p>

<p>Since Halloween is on Saturday, we all dressed up as the Peaches - pink dresses, red socks and hats. Our team was the best-dressed of the
evening.</p>

got really tired at the end. Our team was lacking most of our strong players, and we didn&rsquo;t play very well at first. Eventually we got our
shit together and stopped turning it over so much.</p>

    <p>Two games, two very different results. First game, we smoked our opponents. We scored twice as many points as they did, which is pretty
difficult to do in indoor. We were even missing our first-round guy, and started off with almost no guy subs because many of our guys were
running late. Still, we played well, moved the disc to the break side easily, and got a lot of Ds.</p>

<p>Second game, the exact opposite. We started off pretty weak and went down 5-1. After a timeout, we refocused and picked up our game, but we
still struggled with poor spacing and unforced mistakes. Our opponents backed us hard and forced us to cut under, which we did. But we moved
the disc to the open side too readily and got stuck in the black hole corner too often. People didn&rsquo;t stay out of the endzone, so scoring
was also difficult. And on turns, our defense was lacking. We did close the gap to 3 points at the very end, but they were in control the
whole time and milked the clock nicely to end the game.</p>

    <p>After lot of team shifts and last-minute scrambling for players, we scraped together a squad to send to Clambake. I only knew half the team
going into the weekend, but they turned out to be a great bunch. We also had people drop and pick up as the tourney progressed. We ended up
winning all our pool games and making it all the way to semis before Silence of the Clams knocked us out. The weekend was cold and windy on
the whole, so a lot of games were upwind-downwind turnoverfests. Our &ldquo;bobbing for shots&rdquo; game went over really well during the day. The game
didnt make it to the party because we went hard pretty early and lost focus.</p>
