    <p>Played 2 hours of mini at the Yale IM fields. I felt very out of shape, most likely because I spent all winter lifting heavy and not running
at all. Chasing Ross and Bosco around for 2 hours killed me. Really looking forward to switching to Crossfit/shuttles for the next few

    <p>Two days of semi-serious ultimate in tiger costumes. Calvinball was a prety stacked team, but we managed to play quite poorly. We lost some
games we shouldn&rsquo;t have (including one on universe after being up 8-2 at half), we failed to take advantage of our 2-pointer rule, and we
were overall not very focused. But that&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s fools fest. Personally I tried not to play much, and I was mostly happy with how that
went. I got a layout D on a hammer, caught a two-pointer, caught a Callahan on a scoober dump, and only had a few turnovers. It was quite
windy, especially on Sunday, but even my &ldquo;start-on-O-upwind&rdquo; strategy failed to backfire :-).</p>

    <p>Half an hour of throwing with Adubs. Worked on my flicks. I&rsquo;m releasing my flick too far in front of my body, which makes it hard to keep it
I/O and hard to put power on it.</p>

<p>After throwing, 90 minutes of BAD. Today&rsquo;s focus was lateral movement - resisted shuffles and shuffle suicides were the main event. Then we
did our standard medball core workout and cardio circuit. At the end, I talked everyone into doing sled push relays, which ended up being
tougher than I expected (but still fun).</p>

<p>Before the workout, I measured my vert. Standing vert was <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>&ldquo; </span>, and I got <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">30</span>&rdquo; </span> with the approach. This is almost exactly the
same numbers I got in Boston in 2010 (26" standing, 30" approach). I didn&rsquo;t warm up though, so I think I can do better. Kevin told me that I
don&rsquo;t swing my arms aggressively enough, and that I need to swing them straight up.</p>

    <p>Today was the same as yesterday, but with C&amp;J instead of snatch. I got there early, but the place was still packed by the time I got into
the heavy sets. I guessed high for my 1rm target (didn&rsquo;t want to start really low like yesterday) and ended up being pretty dead-on. I
started at ~55kg and jumped up pretty quickly to about 75kg. From there, I went in small steps up to 85kg. My cleans were decent near the
end, but my jerks were pretty bad. My 85kg jerk was maybe the ugliest one I&rsquo;ve ever done. Still, it would have counted in competition, so
I&rsquo;m counting it. I tried 85 a second time and failed the jerk.</p>

    <p>The plan was to start 20kg below my target 1RM, do 5 reps at that weight, 5 reps at +5kg, 5 at +10kg, then singles the rest of the way,
going up 1-3kg at a time. But I didn&rsquo;t really have a target, so I started way too low and spent a long time working my way up. I went pretty
strong up to 58kg, then missed 3 times at 60kg right before they closed. It only started to feel heavy towards the end, so I think I could
have hit it with a bit more time and practice. The feedback I got was to focus more on my form. I was just jerking the bar up when it got
heavy, instead of focusing on good form and using my legs to drive hard. I think my best single lift was around 55kg. It really felt solid
because I dropped under the bar and it didn&rsquo;t really move after. It just stopped in place, and then I squatted it up.</p>

    <p>Played an hour of indoor with the Colt guys and Baywatch girls. We were pretty low on numbers and we were playing make-it-drop-it, so by the
end we were pretty dead. It was still fun, and I&rsquo;d do it again.</p>

    <p>First day at BAD (Better Athletic Development). Some of the Metro North ppl got a class to themselves. It&rsquo;s pretty similar to the Spinners
workout sessions from last year, though I think Ben&rsquo;s stuff was better (but it&rsquo;s too early to judge). We worked on sprint form and power,
core stuff, and then overall fitness circuit. Core was the worst for me, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll get better at it. The sprinting work was good. I
learned that I need to swing my arms higher (&ldquo;cheek to cheek&rdquo;), which will cause my stride to lengthen and I&rsquo;ll run faster. I have good
turnover, but dont gain as much ground on each step as I could. It&rsquo;s probably because I play defense all the time.</p>

    <p>Record low attendance (4 guys, 6 girls) meant lots of PT for me. I was extra tired by the time we finished. Maybe its the two tough games
yesterday, maybe its the focus on lifting over the past few months. Either way, time to take a day off tomorrow.</p>

    <a class="js-collapse" itemprop="name">Woodbridge Finals</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two solid indoor games. The first was against UConn (Liz/Saipher/Mary/others). We didn&rsquo;t play well (start off down 5-1) and the game was
quite chippy overall. We eventually clawed our way into the game, switched to backhand to prevent their easy hammer scores, and went up a
few points at the end. As time was running out, we buckled down and closed it out to win by 2.</p>

<p>The second game was the best game of the season. We played Colt/Baywatch. They were the favorite, with lots of solid club guys and
a deep roster. They only had two women, and we tried to take advantage of that, but I think it was pretty even. The whole game was very
close and very spirited. We forced middle the whole game (props to Bosco for the brilliant idea) and made sure we were subbing super fast.
We even created two subbing groups for the second half to make sure our lines were well-balanced.</p>

<p>I think the force middle really got to them, because their offence (normally very fast-paced and trigger-happy) slowed down a lot. We often
forced them to throw 20 or even 30 throws before they could score. Big props to the improved defense from everyone. On offense, Shockey
dominated. He probably scored half our goals that game. Bosco started throwing him floaty dimeballs, and eventually I found my stride and hit
him on a few nice hucks too. I think he only got beat in the air once.</p>

<p>When time ran out in the second half, the score was 20-20. They had just scored, so we decided it would be a universe-point game with us on
offense. We subbed in our best line and started working the disc. After 3 throws, Bosco unleashes a floaty hammer to CJ for the win. It
floats a bit too long, and gets D-ed toward me. I catch it and throw CJ game-winner. A very exciting end to a very good game.</p>

<h3>Team Wins</h3>

<ul>
<li>Force middle. Damn smart.</li>
<li>We finally subbed at the right pace. I&rsquo;m just as guilty of staying on too long as anyone. I&rsquo;m happy we finally did it right.</li>
<li>Great execution on the force middle. Sideline presence was strong and got everyone into the game. Several people had never played FM
before, but they did a great job figuring it out and implementing it. I&rsquo;d say this was the biggest factor in our win.</li>
<li>Strong deep game from Andy/Shockey. Really kept us in the game.</li>
<li>Excellent spirit from both teams.</li>
<li>Free beer for us after the game.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal Wins</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reeled in my bad throws from the first game, threw better deep looks in the second game.</li>
<li>D was on point. Got a nice layout D on Timmer in the endzone, an almost-handblock, and generally played my guy tight (plus ran some nice switches).</li>
<li>Biggest win was the last point. Not that I saved the hammer or threw the goal, but that I made myself get in position to clean up the
trash. When I&rsquo;m tired, I take mental shortcuts and just hope that things will work out. I clearly remember thinking &ldquo;oh, I don&rsquo;t need to
back CJ up. either he&rsquo;ll catch it or its a D&rdquo;. And my next thought was &ldquo;well, I can get close enough for a small chance at a second
attempt&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened, and it won us the game. This mental weakness has been a point of internal struggle for a
while, and I won that struggle today.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Needs Improvement</h3>

<ul>
<li>Still too risky/inconsistent with my deep throws.</li>
<li>Need to learn to better recognize when someone is open or not. I&rsquo;ve been hesitant on some throws to open players, when I should be hitting
them.</li>
<li>Starting giving-and-going towards the end, but still not natural.</li>
</ul>
