    <p>Excellent weekend of ultimate. I haven&rsquo;t won a non-playoffs tournament since Philly Invite last year. Also, I really felt like our team grew and learned a lot this weekend. We had a lot of subs on Saturday and won all our pool play games (none were very challenging). Then we lost our crossover to SHUYAMOUF because we did not defend the deeps well. We started strong, going up 5-2. Then they scored 10 points in a row. We came back some with a run of our own, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to win the game.</p>

<hr />

<p>On Sunday, all the Spinners left for their game so we were down to about 10 guys. But I liked that better because I got to play more and connect more with everyone else. We won our first game against Bang, then played Lions in semis. They took half 8-3 to start, then we got a break to go to 10-5, and then we scored 6 straight to win the game on 11-10 on hard cap. That was one of the most exciting comebacks I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of. Devlin gave a great half-time speech about wanting to feel our team from the sideline and our defense refocused to execute our gameplan. We took away the deeps and the arounds, and they collapsed. I caught a great huck from Harrison to tie it at 10s and Katie hit Ben with a hammer to win the game.</p>

<p>In the finals, we played SHUYAMOUF again. They gained their MLU players (Sean Murray and Lucas), but Amp was on fire. We started off strong and never looked back. They only beat us deep one or two times, scoring most of their goals in the front corner of the endzone or on nice IO breaks. We did slack off on taking away the arounds - will have to work on that in the future. Our ladies were especially dominant, getting several nice Ds and shutting down their assignments. In the last few points, they were completely uncovered for multiple cuts in a row. The guys also played well. Bulb caught the winning goal by walking to the throw in the enzone - there was no one even close to him.</p>

<hr />

<p>I had the honor of being named the mens MVP for the tourney for playing strong back-hip D, attacking the break side with my throws, and deciding to stop throwing my deep throws that weren&rsquo;t working. Sara got the women&rsquo;s MVP for repeatedly breaking the mark and for several heads-up Ds during the day. We celebrated with some all-natural chocolate milk and dinner at <strike>Guacamole</strike>Desi Village. Amp!</p>
