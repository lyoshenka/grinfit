    <a class="js-collapse" itemprop="name">Wildwood 2014</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Another awesome Wildwood is in the books. Random friends were seen, beach ultimate was played, beers were shotgunned, and we even a trophy. Here&rsquo;s how it went down.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>I started the weekend by fooling everyone into thinking that I&rsquo;m now the TD of wildwood. The crew asked me to send an email to every player at the tourney to tell them some useful info (be respectful, no glass on the beach, watch out for plainclothes cops, etc). But the way it came off, it was like I was making the announcement, and that&rsquo;s usually the TD&rsquo;s job. All weekend people came up to me asking about cops and saying they didn&rsquo;t know I was in charge of wildwood now. I set most of them straight, but sometimes it was easier to just go with it.</p>

<p>Friday was also the start of our weekend-long game of Gems. Everyone started with 5 gems, and whoever had the most by the end of the weekend got to keep the trophy. People were flipcupping for gems, betting gems (I won 3 on an arm wrestle between Diana and Katie), and even giving gems away for things. It definitely spiced the weekend up.</p>

<p>After pregaming at the house, we head for the Bolero. We danced for a bit, then bounced and went for ice cream and skinny-dipping in the ocean. The water was surprisingly warm, and the ice cream was surprisingly good - vanilla with strawberries on top. That sobered us up some, so we went home to party some more.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>Our theme for the weekend was a bit unusual: you must wear (at most) one article of clothing and it must cover your back. We had some interesting choices - dresses, panda suits, wrestling singlets, full-body spandex suits, even a kimono. I went with a fullbody suit on Saturday and a dress on Sunday. The suit was a big hit, and not all that bad to play in. I thought it would be super-hot (it was) and that throwing in those gloves would be tough (it wasn&rsquo;t). We spent most of the day drinking and chilling with people. We won all our games (both Troyalty and Troylettes) without too much of a struggle. One of the teams we played was solid, but we stepped our game up and won by 4, our closest win of the day.</p>

<p>The party was quite good this year, mostly because we didn&rsquo;t spend too much time at the Bolero. We pregamed at the house, then went out. Robb and I went ahead of the rest, and we went straight to the Rabs party room by the pool. When we migrated to the Bolero dancefloor, Diana was already there. We spent maybe 5 min inside, then went back to the Rabs room and to the pool area. After much socializing and big-containering and dice-gaming, our thoughts turned to food and we went to buy way more Chinese than we needed (though Singapore noodles were delicious). We ate on the steps near our house, then went in for the afterparty and for bedtime.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>Sunday went pretty similar to Saturday. The teams we played were better, but we were never down on points. Our two-pointers were decent, our guys were very solid, and our ladies carried the day as usual. I thought we&rsquo;d have trouble against Esser&rsquo;s team, but we went up big and they didn&rsquo;t manage to catch up in time. In the finals, we played Max Power, a Canadian team that played in Borocay and other beach tournaments. We talked them into playing Pick-6, which turned out great. I ran back a pick-6 for a goal, then threw a pick-6 Callahan shortly afterwards. Our first game to 7 was closer than it should have been. I threw a 2-pointer at 5-5 to win it, but it could have gone either way. Our second game was not as tight. I think we won 7-3 or 7-2. After the games, I played an awesome spirit game of 1-on-1 hockey in the sand. We each had a tiny hockey stick and the puck was a tennis ball. I lost my game, then Diana played one of their girls and lost as well. But we did drink tasty Canadian whiskey, so really everyone won.</p>

<p>Troylettes lost their second game on Sunday, so they were done at this point. There was nothing left to do but collect the trophy, take some photos, and then count our gems. We met back at the house and went through the final calculations. After much trading and consolidating, Stefan and I were the clear leaders. It was very close, and we each did some shots and promised some things to get the last few. We&rsquo;re now both wearing our costumes to FGiving, and I owe Steve a cheesesteak next time I&rsquo;m in Troy. In the end, I had two gems more than Stefan so I took home the MVP title and the trophy. I like to think of it as being voted &ldquo;most entertaining&rdquo; by the team.</p>

<p>Lessons for next year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gems game was great, but the small gems were annoying.</li>
<li>Prepare a spirit game. They are very fun.</li>
<li>Team theme for next year: fun police.</li>
<li>Robb should be in charge of swag.</li>

    <p>Our mid-week AMP practice was cut short by a thunderstorm, but not before the D line kicked the O line&rsquo;s ass in several short scrimmages. We struggled with downfield cutting and the dump sets. Our D after a turn was also pretty bad. That&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p>

    <p>Ran a few drills with Devlin and Glazer before our game. Did the 10-cut drill 3 times, then did the triangle cutting drill (cut deep, cut under, slash break, cut deep again, all while watching the throwing and cutting off their fakes) 2 times each on the forehand and backhand side.</p>

<p>Then played all but one point in our 15-14 loss to Rosso&rsquo;s team. We played quite poorly across the board, with everyone having bad turnovers and other mistakes (Betsy dropped the pull). Yet we still managed to get a bunch of breaks and win the insanely long points we played. We went up a break at 11-10, they got the break back at 13s, and then it was universe point. We even got the D fairly close to their endzone, but could not convert. They scored for the win.</p>

<p>After the game we had a good showing at team hangout. I drank two smoothies from the smoothie truck (one before the game, one after) and ate a bunch of Paella from Bulb&rsquo;s team.</p>

    <p>Just finished my first 24-hour fast. It was not dificult at all. I felt hungry most of the time, but it was never too distracting or annoying. I was inspired to do it after reading Eat, Stop, Eat. The author does a pretty good job analyzing the existing medical research on fasting and makes a bunch of points that seem to make sense. Hopefully it works out for me. Time to devour this burrito.</p>

    <p>Had a short throw session with Diana and Raha at Clark Park. We did 10-throw twice through. We didn&rsquo;t stand too far from each other, just focused on reps and pushing our limits. We threw a lot of throws at full extension or as high/low as we could release them. We even threw scoobers and lefty backhands. Those should come in handy at Wildwood next weekend.</p>

    <p>A tight summer league game against Trey&rsquo;s team. We played really well in the first half were up two breaks at halftime. In the second half, we had a bunch of unforced short-field turnovers and they won 15-11. We still played solid defense, but could not overcome all the mistakes. In general, our O was strong when we didn&rsquo;t turn it early. We did a good job opening up space in the middle of the field for the players who were being left uncovered. They then worked it to each other and marched the disc up the field into the endzone. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how we did, especially considering that Jeff, Katie and Diana were not playing (though we picked up Yoli to take Diana&rsquo;s spot).</p>

    <a class="js-collapse" itemprop="name">Penn Park Throwing and Defense</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Second workout of the day. I skipped out on most of the sprints, shuttles and hill sprints because I lifted earlier. Instead I threw with Gabe and Maddie. Then I worked on defensive positioning and threw some more.</p>

<p>For the record, here&rsquo;s the workout:</p>

<h2>20m Sprints</h2>

<p>Do a bunch of 20m sprints with different starts. Start facing different directions, loading one leg or the other, leaning forwards, stepping backwards, etc. My favorite was to set up as if you&rsquo;re covering someone in the stack and have them cut in while you chase. If the defender beats the cutter to the line, they win a prize (in this case, a chicken wing). Rest for full recovery between sprints.</p>

<p>I skipped everything but the O-D sprints.</p>

<h2>Shuttles</h2>

<p>Sprint 50m, do 5 side-to-side shuffles between two cones, sprint 50m, shuffle again, sprint 50m. Not sure what the rest is, I&rsquo;d do 1-2min.</p>

<h2>Hill Sprints</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t see what they did because I was throwing, but I did discover that Penn Park has some nice short hills to sprint up.</p>

<h2>Defense Drill</h2>

<p>Did Nick&rsquo;s box drill several times. Worked on focusing on my defenders hips, staying close to them and being on the correct side of them. Also on my footwork. Papa pointed out that on Amp, we tend to spend a lot of time watching the disc when our person is not active. That&rsquo;s important, but we should be spending more time watching our person and only glancing at the disc momentarily to get an idea of what&rsquo;s going on. This will let us react faster to our person making a move, and we&rsquo;ll be closer on the D.</p>

    <p>NY Invite. Haven&rsquo;t been to this tourney since 2009, when it rained insanely hard and the games did not get called off until after the fields were wrecked. Maybe they haven&rsquo;t been able to get the fields since&hellip;</p>

<p>I continued in my role as the primary O-line cutter. I think I played better this weekend. I only had 3 turnovers - two hit my receiver in the hands and one was a good look but a bit too low and too far for Benny to catch up to. I played fairly solid D after turns (and even got some D points in during the last game) but I think I could have done better. My favorite games were against Slow, Shuyamouf and CLX.</p>

<p>Lessons from the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>need to continue working on my throws, especially on putting enough snap on my flicks and on reaching out on my backhands.</li>
<li>am getting better with the shape of my cuts, but need to start deep cuts from closer in.</li>
<li>need to work on executing the proper dump cut. I went upline a good amount but did not come across for the IO at all.</li>
<li>pay more attention to the mental prep and the instructions from captains. they set the focus, but it&rsquo;s easy to forget what is said when you&rsquo;re focusing on the current point.</li>
</ul>


<p>My stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>35 O points, 8 D points</li>
<li>10 goals</li>
<li>4 assists</li>
<li>1 D</li>
<li>3 throwaways, 0 drops</li>
</ul>

    <p>Went through all of Kung Fu throwing with Liam at Clark Park. Only had a few turnovers. We made it through 96 of the Rinky Dink throws before we dropped one. I thought we would get through all 100.</p>

    <p>Played a bunch of goalty with the TopScore crew, Colin, and Matt Michelson. We must have played at least 8 games to 3. The level was pretty high, though D started slacking towards the middle. The last game really picked up the intensity though.</p>

<p>After goalty, dinner at Vientiane Cafe.</p>

    <p>Played a game against Venose &amp; Drake&rsquo;s team. Venose and Adam weren&rsquo;t there, so we went up early and didn&rsquo;t have a tough game. They came back towards the end, btu the game got rained out at 12-9 so that&rsquo;s a win for us. Was gonna do sprints or shuttles after the game, but the rain killed that.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played 3 days (Thurs-Sat) of high-level ultimate in the Twin Cities. It was like having an early Nationals. The top 6 teams from last year&rsquo;s nationals were here, as well as Union (Canada&rsquo;s national champion) and a mixed team from Colombia. I played almost exclusively O line, which is a first for me. I did not feel 100% comfortable all the time, especially with the effectiveness of my cutting and the number of turns I had. But everyone told me I played well and should be happy with how I did.</p>

<p>Overall it was great playing against such strong teams so early in the season. We played Drag'n Thrust and Wildcard to universe (and had the opportunity to win both) and won a universe-point game against Union. We also played decently against Polar Bears, though they beat us 15-9. After games, we had a great time hanging out, partying and exploring with the team. Much bonding was accomplished.</p>

<p>My stats for the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>39 O points, 7 D points</li>
<li>8 goals</li>
<li>7 assists</li>
<li>3 Ds</li>
<li>7 throwaways, 2 drops</li>
</ul>

    <p>Did the T25 Cardio video with my dad and Diana. It was decent, though doing it on cement was a mistake. The bottoms of my feet hurt a lot and I had to stop at a few points to rest them. Overall I didn&rsquo;t feel too tired, but that might be because of the breaks and the down-scaling to minimize impact. After the cardio, we swam a few laps in the pool.</p>
