    <p>I stayed with Miriam on Sunday night after Pro Flight, and she invited me to play goalty with her team. At first I thought I&rsquo;d be too tired
and sore to play, but I decided to come out and see how it went. I ended up playing the whole time and had a blast. The people were fun and
we had the right number of subs - enough to feel fresh but not too many to stand around a lot. I&rsquo;m still learning goalty, so I made a bunch
of mistakes, but I did mack a disc for a goal and throw a Rochester for a goal that was dropped. Overall I noticed that people have a
tendency to all hang out in and around the goal, which makes scoring extra hard. I think more discipline to stay away from the arch would
create more space and make scoring easier.</p>

    <p>6 games across 2 days. We didn&rsquo;t have many players, and lost some to injury as the weekend went on, so I got a lot of reps. I tried out KT
tape for my knee, and am happy to report that it did not bother me at all on Saturday and only hurt a little on Sunday (whether this
correlation implies any causation or not, I still don&rsquo;t know). I had more turns and less Ds this weekend than I did in Colorado, but I also
had to handle more since Lucas wasn&rsquo;t there and Liz is out for the season. I esp played poorly against Amp and Drag'n Thrust, with several
turns in each game that were caused by rushing a throw - my main problem area. If we converted just a few more breaks, we could have won
those games (or at least kept them competitive).</p>

<p>I threw the longest huck for a goal of my life - an 80-yard endzone-to-endzone huck to Mari. To be fair my mark was slow to get set so I had
a wide-open backhand, but it&rsquo;s still a nice achievement.</p>

    <p>Went on a 3-day, 2-night hike in the mountains by Mestia, Georgia. The plan was to hike up to the Guli pass (Гульба), look over the edge,
then come down. But we started our hikes fairly late both days, so we missed the summit by about an hour or two (had to turn back in order
to make it down in time). I&rsquo;d never been on an all-out hike like this. We carried all our food and gear with us. We camped on the glacier
both nights (first night on the rocks embedded in the ice, second night on the snow/ice itself). We used helmets, crampons, harnesses, and
ice picks. It was pretty intense, but a lot of fun. The views were magnificent and the camaraderie was really gratifying. Plus it was great
to see my dad and his friends relive the good old days of &ldquo;extreme hiking&rdquo;, and to meet the next generation of explorers.</p>

<p>By the time we came down on day 3, I was thoroughly exhausted. I hadn&rsquo;t slept well for 3 nights (due to the cold, the snoring tentmates, and
the late-night partying). The descent was pretty challenging, and since I got down first, I went back twice to help the rest of the crew
with their packs. On the upside, my knee hurt a lot less than I expected. Maybe I need to reevaluate what triggers my tendonitis.</p>

    <p>Two days of ultimate at 6000ft. Actually, the altitude didn&rsquo;t bother me nearly as much as I thought it would. I felt fine the whole time. We
did bring a full roster, which helped keep everyone fresh and well-rested.</p>

<p>On the whole, a solid weekend for the team. We lost in the finals and played some games closer than we should have (e.g. Platypi,
Blackbird). But we also had a lot of good moments and some strong comebacks. Our D was especially solid, digging us out of holes a few
times.</p>

<p>Personally, I ended the weekend with a +3 on my score-o-meter (Ds minus turns). My only turn was my first throw of the tourney - a dump to
Lucas that I threw a bit too hard and too wide for him to get to. I think this might be my highest score in a few years. I must be getting
old. I even called a timeout once.</p>

<p>Off the field, this was one of the best tourneys we&rsquo;ve had. Hanging out with Squeege and others in CO was great. The highlight was our
2-hour-long game of Crazy Grapes in Squeege&rsquo;s pool. I also went motown dancing, explored downtown Denver, celebrated Kerry&rsquo;s birthday,
played Dominion, and watched lots of people catch lots of Pokemon.</p>

    <p>Didn&rsquo;t do too much in the way of workouts conditioning. Mostly played ultimate:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 hours at a PoNY tryout. Didn&rsquo;t make the team.</li>
<li>2 days at Mixed Easterns with Metro North. Handled a lot.</li>
<li>1-day round-robin at Lums Pond in DE. Played against AG, AMP, Tyranis and Jug Handle. Also handled a good amount, primarily for the D line.</li>
<li>3 days at Windmill Windup with Cambridge. Played a lot against some good teams. Fairly happy with my play. Got one of the most difficult and awesome
layout Ds of my life.</li>
<li>4 days of beach ultimate at Bar Do Peixe. Definitely more relaxed that the rest of the tourneys, but still a lot of fun and pretty high quality. Played
a total of 11 games, though they were about half an hour each. Played with some awesome women, including probably the best girl in Portugal. Highlights
include my first layout handblock, a hammer handblock, some good D and strong intensity and focus under pressure (sometimes). Also ridiculous partying
every single night, especially Saturday and Sunday.</li>
</ul>


<p>Today, a return to real workouts. Threw with Miriam at Wooster Square for over an hour. Worked on torso torque on my flicks, spin on my leftie backhands, and flight path on my hammers.</p>

    <h2>Sri Lanka</h2>

<p>Two days of low-level pickup. Sri Lanka doesn&rsquo;t have much of an ultimate
scene, but a few players are trying to get it off the ground. They run
pickup several times a week in Colombo, and occasionally travel to other
cities to play. A few of the players have been to tournaments outside the
country (Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia) but most are casual players.</p>

<p>The pickup itself was fun. The weather was really hot and humid. I didn&rsquo;t
have cleats, so I played in my barefoot shoes. There wasn&rsquo;t much stacking
or force-holding, but everyone knew the rules and played with a lot of
spirit and competitiveness.</p>

<h2>Malaysia</h2>

<p>Diana and I picked up with teams for a day of ultimate at the Grizzly Open.
Diana played with the local powerhouse Care Bears. I played with (and even
captained) a team of pickup players from the area. We both had a lot of fun
playing and teaching. Diana even won the tourney in a very close game.</p>

    <p>Played 3 days (Thurs-Sat) of high-level ultimate in the Twin Cities. It was like having an early Nationals. The top 6 teams from last year&rsquo;s nationals were here, as well as Union (Canada&rsquo;s national champion) and a mixed team from Colombia. I played almost exclusively O line, which is a first for me. I did not feel 100% comfortable all the time, especially with the effectiveness of my cutting and the number of turns I had. But everyone told me I played well and should be happy with how I did.</p>

<p>Overall it was great playing against such strong teams so early in the season. We played Drag'n Thrust and Wildcard to universe (and had the opportunity to win both) and won a universe-point game against Union. We also played decently against Polar Bears, though they beat us 15-9. After games, we had a great time hanging out, partying and exploring with the team. Much bonding was accomplished.</p>

<p>My stats for the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>39 O points, 7 D points</li>
<li>8 goals</li>
<li>7 assists</li>
<li>3 Ds</li>
<li>7 throwaways, 2 drops</li>
