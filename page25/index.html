    <p>Amp&rsquo;s first tournament of the season. I&rsquo;m still coming back from my tendonitis, so I only played half a day on Saturday. The weekend was a mix of ups and downs for me. I started off on a huge down, with two drops and three turns in our first game (which we ended up losing). The rest of the games went pretty well. We beat AG on Saturday, then won our quarters game on Sunday and lost a very close game to AG in semis. I caught a layout Callahan against AG.</p>

<p>Things I need to improve: cutting on O. My awareness is decent but needs work, especially paying attention to my teammates. I also need to learn to stop and cut faster and to throw better into the wind. Finally, fewer turns. Maybe it was just my first game outside, but the throwaways were poor decisions and that&rsquo;s no good.</p>

<p>EDIT: also got bit by a tick sometime this weekend. This might come in handy later.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been really lazy for the past two weeks: combination of rehabbing and being busy at work. So to get back in the habit, I&rsquo;m gonna start trying to work out in the morning. That way I&rsquo;ll make sure I&rsquo;m getting it done.</p>

<ul>
<li>10 pushups, 1 squat</li>
<li>9 pushups, 2 squats</li>
<li>etc</li>
<li>1 pushup, 10 squats</li>
</ul>


<p>Total: 55 pushups, 55 squats</p>

<p>Time: 3:07</p>

<p>The time makes sense considering I can do 40 burpees in just over 2 minutes.</p>

I also ran back a pick-6 for a goal.</p>

    <p>A few AMP guys and friends of the team scrimmaged the Haverford mens' team. We played a game to 6 first (which we won 6-2), then played about 6 or 7 points of zone against them to give them more practice. Finally, we mixed up the teams and scrimmaged for half an hour or so. We didn&rsquo;t have many subs, so I got to play a lot. Haverford has several players who are very strong, but they didn&rsquo;t move the disc too well and relied on being taller and more athletic.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Great workout at Penn Park. We had at least 10 people. Did a bunch of things:</p>

<h2>Dynamic Warmups and Agility Ladder</h2>

<p>Various jumping, twisting stretches and speed ladder drills to warm up. Some throwing as well.</p>

<h2>10x80m Sprints on the Minute</h2>

<p>Start a clock. Every minute on the minute, sprint 80 meters. Spend the rest of the time walking back to the starting line.</p>

<p>This workout is supposed to be 100m, but we only had room for 80.</p>

<h2>Give and Go drill</h2>

<p>Ran the one side give-n-go drill a few times. There were 4 stationary players, and we ran by them giving and going with each. We did backhands in one direction, leftie backhands in the other. We did 4 or 5 reps of this.</p>

<h2>Short Cutting Box</h2>

<p>Set up a 10m box with a disc in the middle. Cut to the center, then out to a corner, then back to the center, then the next corner, etc. 3 reps of this.</p>

<h2>Defensive Footwork Drill</h2>

<p>Papa and I worked on our change of direction. We worked on making the right steps and on keeping our hips square with the cutter.</p>

<h2>Mini mini</h2>

<p>Played a very small mini game.</p>

<h2>Greek Lady supper club</h2>

<p>Milkshakes and gyros with everyone.</p>

    <h2>Ultisquash</h2>

<p>The veteran&rsquo;s ultisquash fight club committee decided to honor Diana and me by inviting us to their elite game. In attendance: Wheels, Schmucker, TC, Panna, Dre, Raha, us. We played a dozen or so games, all intense and fast-paced. I really enjoyed playing with Schmucker and Wheels. They don&rsquo;t come out much and I don&rsquo;t get to play with them that often. Also covering TC was a lot of fun. What a great way to end the season.</p>

<h2>Spinners Practice</h2>

<p>I was rather sore after all that ultisquashing, but decided to go to Spinners practice anyway. The weather was finally nice and it&rsquo;s good to get my outdoor throws straight as early as possible. We spent a good amount of time on drills and working on some set plays, then scrimmaged a lot. We started our first set of scrimmages with a hunger-drill throw to simulate playing after a huck. I&rsquo;ve never done that before but I really like it. We also played a bunch of 2-minute make-it-take-it games and worked on double-teaming.</p>

<p>I was really tired by the time we started scrimmaging, and it didn&rsquo;t help that we had very few subs. I thought I played reasonably well and had some good throws and cuts, though I dropped the disc TWICE during the 4 lines cutting drill (where we were specifically trying not to drop the disc by focusing on catching one point of it) and also turfed an easy throw to DBaer because I didn&rsquo;t pivot.</p>

    <p>Lost all three games today - two with my core team, then the finals with Off To Grandma&rsquo;s. We sucked in the finals. Our spacing and timing was way off, we made a lot of mistakes, and we didn&rsquo;t force enough turns. We had some good moments, especially in the 3rd quarter when we got a few breaks back. But it wasn&rsquo;t enough. They won 28-20. At least we got to do the Off to Grandma&rsquo;s cheer that I&rsquo;ve been setting up all season.</p>

    <p>Played a great game against Bill and Stacy&rsquo;s team. We were on point the whole game and executed our game plan well. We went up big in the 3rd quarter and finished the game 30-18. Ppl on the sidelines remarked that Bill&rsquo;s team seemed to drop a lot of discs, so our win was partially due to their bad luck (or lack of focus?). Still, we earned a spot in the finals on Sunday.</p>

    <p>Last regular-season game, and it&rsquo;s against the 1 seed. They didn&rsquo;t play like they&rsquo;re the best team in the league, but they did beat us by 10 or so and they are solid all around. We played pretty well, and having Leo really helps. He&rsquo;s a great thrower and he knows when to cut deep. If only we&rsquo;d had Tom, Ashley and Ashley, we could have had a really close game.</p>
