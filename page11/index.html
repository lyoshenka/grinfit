    <p>6 games over 3 days at the US Open. We did really well, winning our pool (despite a last-game loss to Polar Bears) and then losing a close
game to Slow in the semis. Personally, I wasn&rsquo;t at the top of my game because my toe was killing me, but it actually got better throughout
the weekend and I played my best game against Slow. I even got a shoutout after games on Saturday for continuing to cut hard even late in
the day/tournament.</p>

<p>Besides the ultimate, I had a lot of fun hanging out with the team. We drank beer, went swimming in the ocean, played games, watched
ultimate, and enjoyed each others company. It was a great start to the season.</p>

around some. Ended up being great weather and the ideal amount of running.
Even my messed up toenail wasn&rsquo;t a problem (good to know for this weekend).</p>

    <p>Two long, hot days of ultimate with not many subs. The D line guys were practically savage all weekend, especially Saturday. DJ left halfway
into the second game, so the four of us (Lucas, Billy YoungJo, and I) played every D point after that. Occaisionally one or two others would
sub in and help out, but that was basically it. On top of that, I did a bad job taking care of myself (not enough water, salt and sunblock, not
enough sleep and food the day before). In one of the very last points of the fourth game, I cramped up super-hard (both hamstrings and a
calf) and had to lie on the ground for 10 min before I could get up again. Thankfully the game ended and we were done for the day.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I took extra care to eat and drink a lot (I also ice-showered the night before), and felt way better. We were still low on
numbers, but DJ returned and John G&rsquo;s hamstring felt better so he played a few points. Despite playing the whole previous day, I felt less
tired after Sunday than I did after Saturday. The caffeine and electrolyte pills probably helped too.</p>

<p>Game-wise, I guess I played well. I&rsquo;m not happy about my lack of forced Ds and how tired I felt, but its hard to compare that to a normal
game where I&rsquo;ll have proper subs. I didn&rsquo;t throw many turnovers, which is great for me, but I did make several fatigue-induced mistakes (not
helping out on a few discs, getting beat upline, dropping two discs that I had my hands on, some throwaways). Then again, I played solid
defense the vast majority of the time. Even in the last game, I stuck close to my guy a lot and ran a few nice switches with Billy. I guess
my main problem was summoning the will to cut hard after a turn, esp late in the day. On the points where I forced myself to go hard, we
usually did well and scored quickly. On the points where I was too tired, it was hard to make things happen. I gained a lot of respect for
the other guys on the line (esp Billy) and their nonstop effort after turns.</p>

<p>I picked up a few minor injuries (a bruise under my big toe nail, some soreness in my tendons), but my tendonitis doesnt seem to be
bothering me today. I hope it still feels good after US Open next week, and continues to hold throughout the season.</p>

    <p>Played a close game against Alex Morrone&rsquo;s team. We started off slow but came back at the end to win it 16-14. I played an ok amount at
first, but then played most of the last few points to bring us back on top and take the win.</p>

<p>Straight from there, drove to Porcfest for two days of camping, LBRY and freedom.</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Overhead Squats, building to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">75</span>lb </span></li>
<li>8/side Dead Bugs</li>
</ul>


<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time (9:00 cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>12-9-6-9-12 Overhead Squats</li>
<li>30 Bicycle Kicks (15/side) after each set of squats</li>
</ul>


<p>I just used a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">45</span>lb </span> bar for the squats, but probably should have gone heavier. I went of my calculated 1RM on the squats, but it was
probably somewhat old and I&rsquo;ve gotten stronger since then.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<h3>Support Holds On Box (5 x 30sec)</h3>

<p>Arms fully locked out, pits of elbows forward, shoulder blades pulled back and down.  Keep torso upright, stay tight. Rest 30 seconds
between efforts.</p>

<h3>Push Ups (4 x 8)</h3>

<p>2 second hold at top (hollow position) and at the bottom.  Rest 30 seconds between sets</p>

<h3>Arch Hold With PVC (4 sets for max time)</h3>

<p>Rest as needed between efforts.</p>

<h3>Box Dips (Foot Assisted) (3 x 10)</h3>

<p>Use feet to help with the movement so as not to overload the shoulder.  Elbows stay tight to body, chest upright, tight core.  Rest 30
seconds between sets.</p>

<h3>Squat Holds (5 x 30-60sec hold)</h3>

<p>This is an active hold, not a stretch.  Perform an air squat and hold the bottom. Fight for upright torso position.  Rest as long as you
were able to hold.</p>

    <p>90 min of goalty at Miriam&rsquo;s going-away party. We played double-goal goalty for the first time. It was fun, though I prefer single-goal
because its encourages better defense. With two goals, you expect to get scored on so you hang back to protect against the fast break on the
way back. So you don&rsquo;t always sprint to get back and protect your goal. Besides that, it was a great time.</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>5 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Back Squats @ 70% 1RM</li>
<li>8 Barbell Bicep Curls</li>
</ul>


<p>My 1RM is never really that accurate. I did my first set at 155lb, then bumped it up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">165</span>lb </span> for the rest. Curls were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">55</span>lb </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 Rounds for Time (8:00 Time Cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>15 Wall Balls @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span></li>
<li>10 KB Swings @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">53</span>lb </span></li>
<li>10 Chin Ups (or 5 Ring Muscle Ups)</li>
</ul>


<p>I came very close to finishing it all in 8 min, but missed by a bit. I got through all the wall balls and 4 swings on the last round before
time ran out. The chin ups were pretty tough. I think I kept putting my hands too wide on the bar to facilitate kipping, but then I didn&rsquo;t
get a good enough grip on it. I also tried out these new grips that they had at the gym to keep my calluses from ripping, but that made it
harder to hold onto the kettlebell and the wall ball.</p>

<p>6 rounds of Snatch Complex. Start a round every 90 seconds. One round is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lift Off</li>
<li>Snatch Pull</li>
<li>Snatch High Pull</li>
<li>Power Snatch</li>
</ul>


<p>I started with 65lb and went up to 75lb halfway through. The goal was to focus on form, not get a high weight. I still have trouble with the
bar following the correct path on the way up (not hitting my knees, touching my thighs).</p>

<h2>Abs</h2>

<p>Tabata Abs. Two rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>AbMat Sit-ups</li>
<li>Tuck Ups</li>
<li>Russian Twists @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>lb </span></li>
<li>Bicycle Kicks</li>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 Total DB Snatches @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">40</span>lb </span></li>
<li>6cals on the assault bike (subbed for 8 10m Line Touches)</li>
<li>8 Slam Balls @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span></li>
<li>max reps Russian Twists w/ Slam Ball</li>
</ul>


<p>You have 1:30 to do each round. Your score is the number of Russian Twists you get through. Rest 1:30 between rounds.</p>

<p>I started with a 35lb DB, but went up to 40lb after the first round because I got a lot of twists in. My numbers were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">27</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">0</span> </span>.
The bike on the last round really killed me. I biked super slow and used up all my time. I just finished the slam balls as time expired.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<p>I missed two weeks of the gymnastics program, so I&rsquo;m doing week 2&rsquo;s workouts now. I didn&rsquo;t do everything because I was tired, but I got in</p>

<ul>
<li>3x6 Slow Pushups (3 seconds down, 3 seconds up)</li>
<li>3x10 Squats with Feet Together</li>
<li>4x20sec Forward Leaning Hold</li>
</ul>

    <p>7 games across 2 days at Windmill. Played the Portuguese and Polish
nationals teams, club teams from all over Europe, a team from Israel, and
one US-ish pickup team. We were very solid for a pickup team, but were
inconsistent and plagued with injuries. Finished 17th with a 4-4 record - a
lot of close losses and hard-fought games.</p>

<p>Personal highlights include a big layout D, several nice hucks, solid
handling and cutting all around, and some good lessons learned about
leadership (mostly: if the team expects you to lead, you have to lead. Even
if you like to keep it loose, you are in charge and need to provide
direction)</p>

<p>The best part of windmill is, or course, the people. Our whole team was
talented, extremely friendly and nice. The Portuguese team was awesome (my
fav game, I think) and I saw a bunch of BDP friends. I also made some new
friends that I hope to see again sometime. Maybe windmill &lsquo;17?</p>

<li>5x60sec Bottom-of-Squat Hold: Rest as long as you were able to hold. Fight for upright torso position.</li>
<li>5x Chin-over-bar Hold for max time: Stay hollow at the top, use a band only if absolutely necessary. Rest as needed between efforts.</li>
<li>4x10 per side One-Legged Box Squats: No rest, just switch sides.</li>
<li>4x30-60sec Plank on Elbows</li>
</ul>


<p>The gymnastics work was pretty brutal today because it was almost exactly the same thing we did during the WOD. I couldn&rsquo;t even do the
chin-over-bar hangs because my hands were dead. The ring rows were really hard as well. The rest of the workout was decent. I killed squat
holds and did fairly well on box squats (though I didn&rsquo;t know the focus was on going slow and balancing). I hit 45sec on each plank.</p>

    <p>Played 2v2 mini with Ross, Diana and Miriam. Started off strong, but got tired and lost the last 4 games straight. Finished with some core
work: 4x15sec bridge, 60sec super plank, 30sec side plank each side. Supper club at Temple Grill.</p>

    <h2>Strength</h2>

<p>20:00min of Clean and Jerk. Build up to a heavy single.</p>

<p>I topped out at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">185</span>lb </span>, which basically ties my PR. I hit the clean on 190, but missed the jerk (twice). Again, same as last time.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>10-8-6-4-2 reps of</p>

<ul>
<li>Power Clean &amp; Jerk @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">115</span>lb </span></li>
<li>Knees to Elbows</li>
</ul>


<p>I finished in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">9</span>:<span class="number">13</span> </span>, just shy of the 10min cap.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<ul>
<li>3x5 Push-ups: 3sec descent and a 5sec hollow hold at the top, actively pushing into the ground. Rest 60 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>3x8 Wall Squats: slow, controlled descent; 2 second hold at bottom. Fight for good position. Rest 60 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>5x30sec Support Holds. Arms fully locked out, pits of elbows forward, shoulder blades pulled back and down. Keep torso upright, stay
tight. Rest 30 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>4x Arch Holds for max time. Rest as needed between efforts.</li>
<li>2-4min Hollow Hold (break up into multiple sets as needed).</li>
</ul>


<p>Today was the first day of the 6-week gymnastic basics program. It&rsquo;s a lot of core work and static holds, with a focus on form and quality
reps. It was all bodyweight stuff, but some of the movements were quite challenging. The wall squats really hit my shoulders hard. The
hollow hold also killed me. I did 40 seconds for my first set, then dropped to 15 and even 10 seconds for the next few sets. I just barely
made it past 2 min before giving up.</p>

    <p>Played a bunch of mini with team topscore. Probably played for an hour at least. Before playing, did some focussed throwing. Afterwards
hucked for ~20 min. Gonna change my pull form to be more like Cenzo&rsquo;s: wind up hard, pause, unwind. Focus on loading all your muscles, then
releasing them one by one. Probably start pulling from my right leg too.</p>

    <p>Had a great time at Beach Nationals with Weekend with Bernie. Everyone on the team were Youngbloods players, except me and Max. The team was
a lot of fun, both on and off the field. We came in seeded 15th but finished 10th. Personally, I played really well on Saturday. I only had
two turns, both against Amp in our crossover game. One was a drop, one was a huck that went just a bit too far. Other than that, my throws
were on point and my D was very solid. The game against Amp was actually my best game, with lots of nice breaks and good cutting.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I played really bad. I threw a bunch of turns, was not focused on D, and was all around pretty meh. Maybe staying up all night
raging <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> make you better at sports?</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>6 sets of: 1 Clean, 3 Front Squats, 1 Jerk. Start a set every 2 minutes (so every 2 min, do a set and the rest for the remainder of the 2
minutes).</p>

<p>I built up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">135</span>lb </span>. Cleans felt solid, front squats were a bit tough, and jerks were quite shaky. I&rsquo;m out of practice.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>2 Rounds for Time (18min cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>32cal Air Bike (instead of 800m run)</li>
<li>20 Clean &amp; Jerks</li>
</ul>


<p>I used <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">105</span>lb </span> for the cleans/jerks. I did all split jerks for the first round, then saw that everyone else was doing push jerks
using the clean as momentum, and realized that was way faster. I switched to that for the second round, but I&rsquo;d wasted too much time and
only got through 17 reps before time expired. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I could have finished the workout if I did push jerks from the start.</p>
