    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>5 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 weighted pullups (strict)</li>
<li>5 weighted pushups</li>
</ul>


<p>I did <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">10</span>lb </span> for each round of pullups, and worked up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">45</span>lb </span> for my last round of pushups.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 AMRAPs today with 2:00 rest between each</p>

<h3>One</h3>

<p>1:00 AMRAP</p>

<p>10 Deadlifts (30sec max). Remaining time: Burpees.</p>

<p>I got through the deadlifts pretty quickly at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">185</span>lb </span>, then got in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">17</span> </span> burpees.</p>

<h3>Two</h3>

<p>1:00 AMRAP</p>

<p>10 Power Cleans. Remaining time: Push Ups</p>

<p>Used <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">115</span>lb </span> for clean and hit <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">13</span> </span> pushups.</p>

<h3>Three</h3>

<p>1:00 AMRAP</p>

<p>Pull ups (kipping is ok).</p>

<p><span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">23</span> </span> for me. Could have probably done 25 if I timed it better.</p>

<h3>Four</h3>

<p>2:00 AMRAP</p>

<p>DB Manmakers. One manmaker is a DB row, pushup, DB row on the other arm, pushup, DB clean, thruster.</p>

<p>I got in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">7</span> </span>  of them with <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">15</span>lb </span> dumbbells. It was rough.</p>

    <p>Played a fun hat tournament run by Slow White. It was great to play with some people that I only get to play against (Miller, Ralph, Davis,
etc). The level of play was reasonaly high, but there were some newer players (league and college players), so it was more fun than intense.
Still, it was a great workout. I got to handle a good amount and cover some great players. Plus our team won the whole thing and got a
last-round bye. What more could you ask for?</p>

<p>Pullups/Pushups/Squats can be broken up any way you want.</p>

<p>I subbed in 20cal on the air bike instead of the run. I knew pushups would be the toughest part for me (esp because we just did 50 in the
first part of the workout), so I tried to break them up in a way that made sense and then do the other stuff as rest between pushups. I
ended up doing roughly 5 pushups at a time, and alternated 5 pullups and 10 squats as my &ldquo;pushups rest&rdquo;. The pushups still killed me, and I
switched to knee pushups after 40 or 45.</p>

pretty close to my calorie goal (48).</p>

<p>Finished with 7 muscle ups and some L holds.</p>

    <p>Tryouts went 3-6pm Saturday and then 9am-noon on Sunday. The format was mostly this: warm up, a bit of cutting/throwing drills, 3v3 mini,
4v4 full-field, 7v7 full-field. I had a lot of fun both days, playing against good players and being outside. The weather was a bit cold and
rainy today, but it really was not a problem.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel a bit more tired that I should (and felt somewhat more tired throughout the weekend then I think I should). I&rsquo;m chalking
it up to early-seasonness, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt this way in previous seasons (even last season, when I took 5 weeks off in
April-May). However, my flick hucks were pretty good for most of the weekend (only had one mistake), my breaks were solid, and my D was good
for the most part. I had a lot of trouble with Korber and Match, but did a good job on just about everyone else. My main problem was my
backhand hucks (I&rsquo;m 0-for-2) and timidness in the air (got skied a few times when I shouldn&rsquo;t have). My I/O flick was also a bit shitty at
times during mini, but that&rsquo;s probably due to fatigue for the most part.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

<p>5-cone zig zag + 25m sprint back to the start. You have to do a full 360 around each cone.</p>

<p>The 360 part was the hardest part, esp because you&rsquo;d never do that in a real game (except Dizzy Bat). My best time was <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">15</span>:<span class="number">34</span> </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>12:00 AMRAP:</p>

<ul>
<li>8 Wall Balls (20lb)</li>
<li>12 KB swings (53lb)</li>
<li>16 AbMat situps</li>
</ul>


<p>Anytime a movement is not done unbroken, it is a 2 Burpee penalty.</p>

<p>The goal of this WOD is to eliminate &ldquo;sudden rests&rdquo; - the feeling that you have to stop right now and you can&rsquo;t do any more reps. The idea
is that you should be planning your rest in every WOD, and keeping a bit in the tank for that last-minute kick. We were allowed to rest
between exercises, but suddenly stopping an exercise would be a penaly. It actually seemed to work out pretty well. I got through <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span> rounds + <span class="number">8</span> reps </span>
of the WOD. I felt tired at the end, but not super dead. I did go a bit harder at the very end, but didn&rsquo;t have all that much &ldquo;kick&rdquo; left.</p>

<p>Finished up with a bit of butterfly pullup practice. I used to be better at those.</p>

<p>Form feedback: when I set up, keep my butt higher and my shoulders in front of the bar (lats over the bar). This will fix my problem of the

<p>I started the workout with a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">135</span>lb </span> bar and a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">30</span>lb </span> ball, but dropped to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">115</span>lb </span> after the first round. Even then, I
didn&rsquo;t finish a single round. I got through 3 sets the first time, 3 sets + 2 reps the second, and back to 3 sets the third, for a total of
<span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span>:<span class="number">37</span> </span> for my score.</p>

    <p>An hour of mini with the FFLD people. My throws were better and my D was reasonably good, but I still get tired too quickly and need more
recovery time between points than I&rsquo;m used to.</p>

<p>While we were playing, a guy came up to us and started talking to us. Turns out he used to play for Sockeye back in the late 90s and is now
coaching a local high school. I think we&rsquo;ll be seeing more of him.</p>

    <p>Played 18 holes of disc golf with the NH crew. I played with disc golf discs, worked on my throws. I noticed that I tend to release the
drivers early, which leads them to veer left. When I try to aim more right or release them later, I don&rsquo;t put enough OI on them and they
veer left because of that.</p>

    <p>Played 2 hours of mini at the Yale IM fields. I felt very out of shape, most likely because I spent all winter lifting heavy and not running
at all. Chasing Ross and Bosco around for 2 hours killed me. Really looking forward to switching to Crossfit/shuttles for the next few
months.</p>

    <p>Two days of semi-serious ultimate in tiger costumes. Calvinball was a prety stacked team, but we managed to play quite poorly. We lost some
games we shouldn&rsquo;t have (including one on universe after being up 8-2 at half), we failed to take advantage of our 2-pointer rule, and we
were overall not very focused. But that&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s fools fest. Personally I tried not to play much, and I was mostly happy with how that
went. I got a layout D on a hammer, caught a two-pointer, caught a Callahan on a scoober dump, and only had a few turnovers. It was quite
windy, especially on Sunday, but even my &ldquo;start-on-O-upwind&rdquo; strategy failed to backfire :-).</p>
