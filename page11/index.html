    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>5 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Back Squats @ 70% 1RM</li>
<li>8 Barbell Bicep Curls</li>
</ul>


<p>My 1RM is never really that accurate. I did my first set at 155lb, then bumped it up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">165</span>lb </span> for the rest. Curls were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">55</span>lb </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 Rounds for Time (8:00 Time Cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>15 Wall Balls @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span></li>
<li>10 KB Swings @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">53</span>lb </span></li>
<li>10 Chin Ups (or 5 Ring Muscle Ups)</li>
</ul>


<p>I came very close to finishing it all in 8 min, but missed by a bit. I got through all the wall balls and 4 swings on the last round before
time ran out. The chin ups were pretty tough. I think I kept putting my hands too wide on the bar to facilitate kipping, but then I didn&rsquo;t
get a good enough grip on it. I also tried out these new grips that they had at the gym to keep my calluses from ripping, but that made it
harder to hold onto the kettlebell and the wall ball.</p>

    <h2>Strength</h2>

<p>6 rounds of Snatch Complex. Start a round every 90 seconds. One round is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lift Off</li>
<li>Snatch Pull</li>
<li>Snatch High Pull</li>
<li>Power Snatch</li>
</ul>


<p>I started with 65lb and went up to 75lb halfway through. The goal was to focus on form, not get a high weight. I still have trouble with the
bar following the correct path on the way up (not hitting my knees, touching my thighs).</p>

<h2>Abs</h2>

<p>Tabata Abs. Two rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>AbMat Sit-ups</li>
<li>Tuck Ups</li>
<li>Russian Twists @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>lb </span></li>
<li>Bicycle Kicks</li>
</ul>


<p>My numbers were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">16</span>,<span class="number">16</span>,<span class="number">26</span>,<span class="number">38</span>,<span class="number">13</span>,<span class="number">13</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">20</span> </span> for a total of <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">162</span> reps </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 Total DB Snatches @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">40</span>lb </span></li>
<li>6cals on the assault bike (subbed for 8 10m Line Touches)</li>
<li>8 Slam Balls @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span></li>
<li>max reps Russian Twists w/ Slam Ball</li>
</ul>


<p>You have 1:30 to do each round. Your score is the number of Russian Twists you get through. Rest 1:30 between rounds.</p>

<p>I started with a 35lb DB, but went up to 40lb after the first round because I got a lot of twists in. My numbers were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">27</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">0</span> </span>.
The bike on the last round really killed me. I biked super slow and used up all my time. I just finished the slam balls as time expired.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<p>I missed two weeks of the gymnastics program, so I&rsquo;m doing week 2&rsquo;s workouts now. I didn&rsquo;t do everything because I was tired, but I got in</p>

<ul>
<li>3x6 Slow Pushups (3 seconds down, 3 seconds up)</li>
<li>3x10 Squats with Feet Together</li>
<li>4x20sec Forward Leaning Hold</li>
</ul>

    <p>7 games across 2 days at Windmill. Played the Portuguese and Polish
nationals teams, club teams from all over Europe, a team from Israel, and
one US-ish pickup team. We were very solid for a pickup team, but were
inconsistent and plagued with injuries. Finished 17th with a 4-4 record - a
lot of close losses and hard-fought games.</p>

<p>Personal highlights include a big layout D, several nice hucks, solid
handling and cutting all around, and some good lessons learned about
leadership (mostly: if the team expects you to lead, you have to lead. Even
if you like to keep it loose, you are in charge and need to provide
direction)</p>

<p>The best part of windmill is, or course, the people. Our whole team was
talented, extremely friendly and nice. The Portuguese team was awesome (my
fav game, I think) and I saw a bunch of BDP friends. I also made some new
friends that I hope to see again sometime. Maybe windmill &lsquo;17?</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>3x16 Suitcase Walking Lunge Step @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">35</span>,<span class="number">40</span>,<span class="number">45</span>lb </span></li>
<li>Butterfly Pullup work. I&rsquo;m basically there, just need to get the tempo and leg movement down so I can do them repeatedly without swinging
wildly.</li>
</ul>


<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 Rounds For Time (17min Cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>20 Pullups</li>
<li>20 Goblet Squats @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">30</span>lb </span></li>
<li>10cal Assault Bike (subbed for 40 double-unders)</li>
</ul>


<p>I did kipping pullups for the first two rounds, but completely tore up my hands in the process. So I switched to SVPUs for the last two
rounds. I finished the workout in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">13</span>:<span class="number">59</span> </span></p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<ul>
<li>3x8 Supine-grip Ring Rows: Slow pull (no snaking or jerking) with a 2 second hold at the top. Rest 60 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>5x60sec Bottom-of-Squat Hold: Rest as long as you were able to hold. Fight for upright torso position.</li>
<li>5x Chin-over-bar Hold for max time: Stay hollow at the top, use a band only if absolutely necessary. Rest as needed between efforts.</li>
<li>4x10 per side One-Legged Box Squats: No rest, just switch sides.</li>
<li>4x30-60sec Plank on Elbows</li>
</ul>


<p>The gymnastics work was pretty brutal today because it was almost exactly the same thing we did during the WOD. I couldn&rsquo;t even do the
chin-over-bar hangs because my hands were dead. The ring rows were really hard as well. The rest of the workout was decent. I killed squat
holds and did fairly well on box squats (though I didn&rsquo;t know the focus was on going slow and balancing). I hit 45sec on each plank.</p>

<p>20:00min of Clean and Jerk. Build up to a heavy single.</p>

<p>I topped out at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">185</span>lb </span>, which basically ties my PR. I hit the clean on 190, but missed the jerk (twice). Again, same as last time.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>10-8-6-4-2 reps of</p>

<ul>
<li>Power Clean &amp; Jerk @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">115</span>lb </span></li>
<li>Knees to Elbows</li>
</ul>


<p>I finished in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">9</span>:<span class="number">13</span> </span>, just shy of the 10min cap.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<ul>
<li>3x5 Push-ups: 3sec descent and a 5sec hollow hold at the top, actively pushing into the ground. Rest 60 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>3x8 Wall Squats: slow, controlled descent; 2 second hold at bottom. Fight for good position. Rest 60 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>5x30sec Support Holds. Arms fully locked out, pits of elbows forward, shoulder blades pulled back and down. Keep torso upright, stay
tight. Rest 30 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>4x Arch Holds for max time. Rest as needed between efforts.</li>
<li>2-4min Hollow Hold (break up into multiple sets as needed).</li>
</ul>


<p>Today was the first day of the 6-week gymnastic basics program. It&rsquo;s a lot of core work and static holds, with a focus on form and quality
reps. It was all bodyweight stuff, but some of the movements were quite challenging. The wall squats really hit my shoulders hard. The
hollow hold also killed me. I did 40 seconds for my first set, then dropped to 15 and even 10 seconds for the next few sets. I just barely
made it past 2 min before giving up.</p>

    <p>Had a great time at Beach Nationals with Weekend with Bernie. Everyone on the team were Youngbloods players, except me and Max. The team was
a lot of fun, both on and off the field. We came in seeded 15th but finished 10th. Personally, I played really well on Saturday. I only had
two turns, both against Amp in our crossover game. One was a drop, one was a huck that went just a bit too far. Other than that, my throws
were on point and my D was very solid. The game against Amp was actually my best game, with lots of nice breaks and good cutting.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I played really bad. I threw a bunch of turns, was not focused on D, and was all around pretty meh. Maybe staying up all night
raging <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> make you better at sports?</p>

<li>20 Clean &amp; Jerks</li>
</ul>


<p>I used <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">105</span>lb </span> for the cleans/jerks. I did all split jerks for the first round, then saw that everyone else was doing push jerks
using the clean as momentum, and realized that was way faster. I switched to that for the second round, but I&rsquo;d wasted too much time and
only got through 17 reps before time expired. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I could have finished the workout if I did push jerks from the start.</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>5 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 weighted pullups (strict)</li>
<li>5 weighted pushups</li>
</ul>


<p>I did <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">10</span>lb </span> for each round of pullups, and worked up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">45</span>lb </span> for my last round of pushups.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 AMRAPs today with 2:00 rest between each</p>

<h3>One</h3>

<p>1:00 AMRAP</p>

<p>10 Deadlifts (30sec max). Remaining time: Burpees.</p>

<p>I got through the deadlifts pretty quickly at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">185</span>lb </span>, then got in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">17</span> </span> burpees.</p>

<h3>Two</h3>

<p>1:00 AMRAP</p>

<p>10 Power Cleans. Remaining time: Push Ups</p>

<h3>Three</h3>

<p>1:00 AMRAP</p>

<p>Pull ups (kipping is ok).</p>

<p><span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">23</span> </span> for me. Could have probably done 25 if I timed it better.</p>

<h3>Four</h3>

<p>2:00 AMRAP</p>

<p>DB Manmakers. One manmaker is a DB row, pushup, DB row on the other arm, pushup, DB clean, thruster.</p>

    <p>Played a fun hat tournament run by Slow White. It was great to play with some people that I only get to play against (Miller, Ralph, Davis,
etc). The level of play was reasonaly high, but there were some newer players (league and college players), so it was more fun than intense.
Still, it was a great workout. I got to handle a good amount and cover some great players. Plus our team won the whole thing and got a
last-round bye. What more could you ask for?</p>

<p>Pullups/Pushups/Squats can be broken up any way you want.</p>

<p>I subbed in 20cal on the air bike instead of the run. I knew pushups would be the toughest part for me (esp because we just did 50 in the
first part of the workout), so I tried to break them up in a way that made sense and then do the other stuff as rest between pushups. I
ended up doing roughly 5 pushups at a time, and alternated 5 pullups and 10 squats as my &ldquo;pushups rest&rdquo;. The pushups still killed me, and I
switched to knee pushups after 40 or 45.</p>

    <p>Tryouts went 3-6pm Saturday and then 9am-noon on Sunday. The format was mostly this: warm up, a bit of cutting/throwing drills, 3v3 mini,
4v4 full-field, 7v7 full-field. I had a lot of fun both days, playing against good players and being outside. The weather was a bit cold and
rainy today, but it really was not a problem.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel a bit more tired that I should (and felt somewhat more tired throughout the weekend then I think I should). I&rsquo;m chalking
it up to early-seasonness, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt this way in previous seasons (even last season, when I took 5 weeks off in
April-May). However, my flick hucks were pretty good for most of the weekend (only had one mistake), my breaks were solid, and my D was good
for the most part. I had a lot of trouble with Korber and Match, but did a good job on just about everyone else. My main problem was my
backhand hucks (I&rsquo;m 0-for-2) and timidness in the air (got skied a few times when I shouldn&rsquo;t have). My I/O flick was also a bit shitty at
times during mini, but that&rsquo;s probably due to fatigue for the most part.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

<p>5-cone zig zag + 25m sprint back to the start. You have to do a full 360 around each cone.</p>

<p>The 360 part was the hardest part, esp because you&rsquo;d never do that in a real game (except Dizzy Bat). My best time was <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">15</span>:<span class="number">34</span> </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>12:00 AMRAP:</p>

<ul>
<li>8 Wall Balls (20lb)</li>
<li>12 KB swings (53lb)</li>
<li>16 AbMat situps</li>
</ul>


<p>Anytime a movement is not done unbroken, it is a 2 Burpee penalty.</p>

<p>The goal of this WOD is to eliminate &ldquo;sudden rests&rdquo; - the feeling that you have to stop right now and you can&rsquo;t do any more reps. The idea
is that you should be planning your rest in every WOD, and keeping a bit in the tank for that last-minute kick. We were allowed to rest
between exercises, but suddenly stopping an exercise would be a penaly. It actually seemed to work out pretty well. I got through <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span> rounds + <span class="number">8</span> reps </span>
of the WOD. I felt tired at the end, but not super dead. I did go a bit harder at the very end, but didn&rsquo;t have all that much &ldquo;kick&rdquo; left.</p>

<p>Finished up with a bit of butterfly pullup practice. I used to be better at those.</p>
