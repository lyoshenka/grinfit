    <p>Played a bunch of mini with team topscore. Probably played for an hour at least. Before playing, did some focussed throwing. Afterwards
hucked for ~20 min. Gonna change my pull form to be more like Cenzo&rsquo;s: wind up hard, pause, unwind. Focus on loading all your muscles, then
releasing them one by one. Probably start pulling from my right leg too.</p>

    <p>Had a great time at Beach Nationals with Weekend with Bernie. Everyone on the team were Youngbloods players, except me and Max. The team was
a lot of fun, both on and off the field. We came in seeded 15th but finished 10th. Personally, I played really well on Saturday. I only had
two turns, both against Amp in our crossover game. One was a drop, one was a huck that went just a bit too far. Other than that, my throws
were on point and my D was very solid. The game against Amp was actually my best game, with lots of nice breaks and good cutting.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I played really bad. I threw a bunch of turns, was not focused on D, and was all around pretty meh. Maybe staying up all night
raging <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> make you better at sports?</p>

<p>6 sets of: 1 Clean, 3 Front Squats, 1 Jerk. Start a set every 2 minutes (so every 2 min, do a set and the rest for the remainder of the 2
minutes).</p>

<p>I built up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">135</span>lb </span>. Cleans felt solid, front squats were a bit tough, and jerks were quite shaky. I&rsquo;m out of practice.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>2 Rounds for Time (18min cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>32cal Air Bike (instead of 800m run)</li>
<li>20 Clean &amp; Jerks</li>
</ul>


<p>I used <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">105</span>lb </span> for the cleans/jerks. I did all split jerks for the first round, then saw that everyone else was doing push jerks
using the clean as momentum, and realized that was way faster. I switched to that for the second round, but I&rsquo;d wasted too much time and
only got through 17 reps before time expired. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I could have finished the workout if I did push jerks from the start.</p>

    <p>Played a fun hat tournament run by Slow White. It was great to play with some people that I only get to play against (Miller, Ralph, Davis,
etc). The level of play was reasonaly high, but there were some newer players (league and college players), so it was more fun than intense.
Still, it was a great workout. I got to handle a good amount and cover some great players. Plus our team won the whole thing and got a
last-round bye. What more could you ask for?</p>

<p>Pullups/Pushups/Squats can be broken up any way you want.</p>

<p>I subbed in 20cal on the air bike instead of the run. I knew pushups would be the toughest part for me (esp because we just did 50 in the
first part of the workout), so I tried to break them up in a way that made sense and then do the other stuff as rest between pushups. I
ended up doing roughly 5 pushups at a time, and alternated 5 pullups and 10 squats as my &ldquo;pushups rest&rdquo;. The pushups still killed me, and I
switched to knee pushups after 40 or 45.</p>

    <p>Tryouts went 3-6pm Saturday and then 9am-noon on Sunday. The format was mostly this: warm up, a bit of cutting/throwing drills, 3v3 mini,
4v4 full-field, 7v7 full-field. I had a lot of fun both days, playing against good players and being outside. The weather was a bit cold and
rainy today, but it really was not a problem.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel a bit more tired that I should (and felt somewhat more tired throughout the weekend then I think I should). I&rsquo;m chalking
it up to early-seasonness, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt this way in previous seasons (even last season, when I took 5 weeks off in
April-May). However, my flick hucks were pretty good for most of the weekend (only had one mistake), my breaks were solid, and my D was good
for the most part. I had a lot of trouble with Korber and Match, but did a good job on just about everyone else. My main problem was my
backhand hucks (I&rsquo;m 0-for-2) and timidness in the air (got skied a few times when I shouldn&rsquo;t have). My I/O flick was also a bit shitty at
times during mini, but that&rsquo;s probably due to fatigue for the most part.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

<p>5-cone zig zag + 25m sprint back to the start. You have to do a full 360 around each cone.</p>

<p>The 360 part was the hardest part, esp because you&rsquo;d never do that in a real game (except Dizzy Bat). My best time was <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">15</span>:<span class="number">34</span> </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>12:00 AMRAP:</p>

<ul>
<li>8 Wall Balls (20lb)</li>
<li>12 KB swings (53lb)</li>
<li>16 AbMat situps</li>
</ul>


<p>Anytime a movement is not done unbroken, it is a 2 Burpee penalty.</p>

<p>The goal of this WOD is to eliminate &ldquo;sudden rests&rdquo; - the feeling that you have to stop right now and you can&rsquo;t do any more reps. The idea
is that you should be planning your rest in every WOD, and keeping a bit in the tank for that last-minute kick. We were allowed to rest
between exercises, but suddenly stopping an exercise would be a penaly. It actually seemed to work out pretty well. I got through <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span> rounds + <span class="number">8</span> reps </span>
of the WOD. I felt tired at the end, but not super dead. I did go a bit harder at the very end, but didn&rsquo;t have all that much &ldquo;kick&rdquo; left.</p>

<p>Finished up with a bit of butterfly pullup practice. I used to be better at those.</p>

</ul>


<p>I built up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">155</span>lb </span> for the triple.</p>

<p>Form feedback: when I set up, keep my butt higher and my shoulders in front of the bar (lats over the bar). This will fix my problem of the
bar hitting my knees on the way up, and me having to pull back instead of up. I should also go a bit slower on the deadlift portion of the
clean.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 rounds for time:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 KBS at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">70</span>lb </span></li>
<li>30 total Russian Twists with a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>lb </span> plate</li>
<li>15 Box jumps on a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">24</span>inch </span> box</li>
</ul>


<p>Rest 1:30 between each round.</p>

<p>My total work time was <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>:<span class="number">18</span> </span></p>

<p>Finished off with 4 muscle ups.</p>

    <h2>Footwork</h2>

<p>5 rounds through an agility ladder (icky shuffle, but with both feet touching outside the ladder) and 2 L drills.</p>

<p>My times started around 22-23 seconds, and came down to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">18</span>:<span class="number">91</span> </span> for my last runthrough. The extra touch on the icky shuffle really
threw me off at first.</p>

    <p>An hour of mini with the FFLD people. My throws were better and my D was reasonably good, but I still get tired too quickly and need more
recovery time between points than I&rsquo;m used to.</p>

<p>While we were playing, a guy came up to us and started talking to us. Turns out he used to play for Sockeye back in the late 90s and is now
coaching a local high school. I think we&rsquo;ll be seeing more of him.</p>

    <p>Played 18 holes of disc golf with the NH crew. I played with disc golf discs, worked on my throws. I noticed that I tend to release the
drivers early, which leads them to veer left. When I try to aim more right or release them later, I don&rsquo;t put enough OI on them and they
veer left because of that.</p>
