    <p>We came, we saw, we conquered (except for Slow). We started the weekend off in classic Metro North fashion: by ignoring everything we
practice and jamming it in the jamhole repeatedly. But we eventually got our shit together, moved the disc well, and raised our game. The
crossover with Slow was an epic back-and-forth game, and we even got the D on the goal line on universe and had the opportunity to win it,
but a nice D by Todd got them the disc back and they converted for the win. On Sunday, we had a really close game with Xist - another
universe-point game, but this time we won it and qualified for Nationals. We played Slow again in the finals, but it was just for seeding
and half our team sat the game out.</p>

<p>Peronally, my main errors were on hucks. When I&rsquo;m rushing my huck or I feel like I have to throw it (when we call Sausage), it never goes
well. When I&rsquo;m throwing in a power position or it feels natural, I&rsquo;m great. Besides that, my game was great - solid defense (including
several points where not only did my guy never touch the disc, but I felt like he was never open at all), strong cutting, and consistently
moving the disc to the breakside. My only turns were 3 hucks, and only one of them was a bad decision. I even felt strong and fast all
weekend, never feeling like I cannot keep up with my defender or cannot keep cutting well.</p>

    <p>An exciting weekend for Metro North. We won the region, beating Slow White (the top seed, and #2 in the country) 15-13 in the finals. That
game was one of the cleanest and most focused games I&rsquo;ve ever played. Our O line only had two turns, and only let Slow convert one of them.
Our D line converted two breaks (I caught both of them :-) ), and had a chance to convert at least one more. I felt like I was completely
in the zone and focused on the game. I did talk to people on the sideline, but I barely remember what I said.</p>

<p>Before the finals, we had a few close games with 7X and Wildcard. I played fairly well in those too, though I had one or two turns on Sat
and missed some D opportunities.</p>

    <p>My first Northeast regionals experience. Pool play on Saturday was fairly
easy. I think we beat every team by at least 6-7 points. Winning our pool
put us up against Slow White in semis. That was one of the best games we&rsquo;ve
played all year. I didn&rsquo;t play much (only a few points), but the team
played well as a whole and we won on universe point. Since there are 4 bids
this year, winning against Slow (only the 2nd time I&rsquo;ve ever beaten them)
made sure that we qualified for nationals, since we couldn&rsquo;t do worse than
3rd at that point.</p>

<p>On Sunday, we played Wildcard in the finals. The game was decent but they
played very strong D, went up 8-6 in the first half, then scored a few more
breaks in the second to seal the win. Then we played Slow White again in
the 2-3 placement game. Once again a solid game. This time they came out on
top. Our defense converted 2 breaks (same as Saturday) but O gave up a few
more that we couldn&rsquo;t make up for.</p>

<p>T minus 18 days until Nationals.</p>

    <p>We cruised through regionals, winning all our games by a good margin. No team made it to double digits against us. Our O line didn&rsquo;t get broken once all
weekend, and we had very few unforced turns all around. The intensity was good, even when we were winning by a lot.</p>

<p>We spent an hour or so on Saturday talking about spirit. Amp often gets low spirit scores, though we don&rsquo;t think we have poor spirit. So there must be
something we&rsquo;re missing, something we need to pay attention to and improve so we&rsquo;re not seen as jerks. Some good points were that we want the teams we beat
to cheer for us and be proud when we represent the region. We don&rsquo;t have to make friendly banter on the sidelines or smile at everyone, but we do need to
respect our opponents as worthy adversaries and recognize when they are doing something well. Some teams we mentioned as examples of good spirit are Polar
Bears, Slow White, Fury, Riot, the men on CLX.</p>

<p>For me personally, I played well on the weekend, though I didn&rsquo;t play much (esp on Saturday). I did have one drop and one rushed semi-throwaway that I
should not have had, but besides that I think I was very effective all around. I did notice myself rushing during our last game. I&rsquo;ll try to remember that
feeling so I can notice it in myself in the future. Brayden (the AG coach) also gave me some good feedback during the game.</p>

<ul>
<li>When I&rsquo;m marked tightly on the flick side, I lift my pivot slightly as I throw to get space. But that&rsquo;s still a travel. I need to either call disc space
or do something else (pivot?) to get the space I need.</li>
<li>When I&rsquo;m near the endzone (or downfield too), I get locked in on one person and wait for them to make the move I want them to make. I need to be careful
of spending too much time on one person. Instead, I should either communicate where I want them to go, or to another cutter.</li>
<li>When I throw the disc laterally from the break side towards the middle, I MUST remember to cut upline immediately. I should practice this.</li>
<li>I made the same dump mistake that I made a few weeks ago in practice (and Katie was my dump again). The mark was counting stalls a bit quickly, so I was
rushed in my head. I turned to look at my dump, but then immediately turned back upfield. I need to commit to the dump and stay with her for at least a
few seconds before looking elsewhere. She&rsquo;s waiting for my look to make her cut, so I can&rsquo;t expect her to be open right away.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rush so much. Learn to notice it and relax when it happens. I think this may lead to my frantic cutting as well.</li>
