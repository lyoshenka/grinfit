    <p>Had an excellent time playing with the Molar Bears at Mosh this weekend. For a first-year team, we set the bar pretty high for level of play, level of
fun, and finish in the tourney (lost in the finals). The wind was rough and the cold was somewhat annoying, but I had a lot of fun.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>

<ul>
<li>drinking tea on the sideline</li>
<li>recruiting for the team turned out awesome</li>
<li>everyone was very positive, had a lot of fun and partied pretty hard (though separately). need to have unified party next time.</li>
<li>every team except Trey&rsquo;s played pick-6</li>
<li>the rollers-are-live rule was fantastic in strong wind</li>
<li>my wind throws have gotten better, and my throwing turns came more from lazy throws</li>
<li>we beat Trey&rsquo;s team on universe</li>
<li>jeremy skied 3 guys in the endzone while wearing fairy wings</li>
<li>jeremy dropped a hand-on-hip hammer for an upwind break in the finals</li>
<li>papa owes me a buffalo</li>
<li>I threw a Rochester for a goal (to the break side to the front of the stack)</li>
<li>I threw Diana a honey goal. She played with her boot on and still got Ds and was effective.</li>
<li>the costumes. next year, no jerseys</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Bicuspids bite, molars crush<br>
Bears love cold. Let&rsquo;s win Mosh</p></blockquote>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>

<ul>
<li>if the wind is so strong that scoring upwind is tough, choosing the wind is equivalent to choosing O/D</li>
<li>conversely, starting on O upwind is good for focus and mental prep. accept the challenge.</li>
<li>we lost in the finals in part because of lack of leadership.

<ul>
<li>we were up 7-5 after half and playing D downwind. we should have broken for 8-5, then
overloaded our O and sealed the deal</li>
<li>millersville adjusted to our strategy at half. we didnt. we should have tried to play more handler-y O going downwind, and I should have called
handlers (scottie and brown) to play upwind O points.</li>
<li>I should have put myself into the cup to stop their crashes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as the captain, I did a good job keeping the vibe positive but I did not attend to the team&rsquo;s needs. I got caught up playing and talking from the
sideline, but I needed to take a step back (multiple times throughout the game) and ask myself &ldquo;what does the team need? what have I done already and
what am I not doing yet?&rdquo;</li>
<li>catch my Ds, then run them back for goals</li>
<li>continue to work on throws in the wind, esp flicks and hammers and short-range throws</li>
</ul>
