    <p>Played Delaware in the WL chumpionship. Our team played quite well overall, and I finally had a game where I&rsquo;m happy with pretty much everything I did. I
subbed fast, I only threw one turnover, and I was fairly effective on O and D. I even threw Diana a huck for a goal and intentionally macked a hammer to
Furf for a goal (against the rules, I know, but it was awesome). I&rsquo;d say the biggest difference between that game and our semis game was the feeling of
relaxation. I did not feel pressure, I did not rush my throws or decisions, everything was more relaxed and smoother. I don&rsquo;t know how much of that is
because we weren&rsquo;t in contention to win the league, how much was because of skill differences (Del was not bad, but they play a slower college style), how
much was something else. I will meditate on this some more.</p>

    <p>Played Bill&rsquo;s Team (Rag Tag) in the semis. Lost by one point (just like the first time we played them) but the game went a bit differently. This time, we
were down most of the way and went on a 6-point run at the end to bring it within 1. We were missing Furf, Raha and Diana. The game was a lot of fun.
Butter instructed me to win with my legs, and I did that fairly well (perhaps too well - I didn&rsquo;t sub enough and got caught tired at moments). Ben&rsquo;s
fitness seems to have helped, but I stil had some bad throwaways. Billy and Sachie played especially well, and Truskin was unstoppable in the air. I threw
the last throw - a blade to Tom in the endzone - that Owen D'ed very nicely to prevent us from going into overtime.</p>

    <p>Started the playoffs with a game against Vanni&rsquo;s team again. They scored the first few, but then we jumped out to a 10-3 lead and never looked back. We
got pretty sloppy in the fourth, messing around and throwing fullfield hammers and thumbers. We just barely missed the big 4-oh, winning 39-16 or so.</p>

    <p>Played RABS in WL. We were close most of the way but got frantic on O in the 4th quarter and let them widen the lead for the win. We played pretty solidly
overall and adjusted well to their game (taking away the deep cuts and the around throws). I did not play that well down the stretch, throwing away some
bad throws in the 4th quarter. I also hurt my knee on a high layout in the middle of the game, but that seems to be doing better.</p>

    <p>Winter league against Trey&rsquo;s team. We came out hot and never let up. Diana, Anna, Billy and Nick played especially well. Butter asked me before the game
to take it easy on deep shots, and I think I did an OK job of that.</p>

    <p>Played against Bills team and Delaware in winter league. The first game was
very close and very heated, esp towards the end. We were up 1 most of the
game but they caught up in the fourth quarter, then passed us. We ended up
losing by 1 after some fouling and clock-rewinding in the last few seconds
of play. In the second game, Delaware was up the whole first half, but in
the second half we switched to flick and pulled away for a solid win. In
general, our team played solid O (though sometimes a bit huck happy or
risky) and fairly good but not excellent D. Personally I threw and caught a
bunch of goals, but also had a lot of turns on rushed goal attempts and
inside backhand breaks. Those are my two areas of focus for next time.
Brandon Silverman told me during the game that I&rsquo;m really good at going to
the disc, so that&rsquo;s another plus.</p>

    <p>Played against the Heva Havas indoor team. They had a double header and looked pretty tired against us, so it wasn&rsquo;t a tough game. But we still tried to push ourselves to play better. They did get off too many breakside hucks, and moved the disc fairly well on O. They also hucked it deep a lot, which lead to some scores but way more turnovers. Personally I threw away a bunch by putting them just a little too far in front without enough float. Need to work on throwing to space, not to the exact spot I&rsquo;m looking. Also IOs still need work. Final score: 37-24.</p>
