    <p>It was gorgeous outside today, so Diana and I went to the park to throw. It wasn&rsquo;t very focused, but I spent at least 10 minutes working on my backhands. I want to be more accurate on tshort backhands that require a lot of snap, but I&rsquo;m usually either off-target or I gun it at the receiver.</p>

We sucked pretty hard on Saturday, mostly because we had a lot of people and a lot of beer. Sunday involved fewer people and beer, so we played better. We also played with the <strong>Pick 6</strong> rule for most of our games. It means that if you catch a D, you can run it back until you get two-hand-touched. Then you play on from wherever you are. If you run it back all the way to the endzone, you score. We had a total of 3 runback goals on the weekend. I didn&rsquo;t have any, though I did throw two Rochester goals (both to Diana) and caught a Callahan.</p>

    <p>Two recent sciency articles related to ultimate:</p>

<h2><a href="http://thesportjournal.org/article/throwing-techniques-ultimate-frisbee">Throwing Techniques for Ultimate Frisbee</a></h2>

<p>A short comparison of throwing techniques based on measuring several characteristics of disc flight (speed, spin, wobble and accuracy). The study compared backhands, split-grip forehands and closed-grip forehands. The only differences they found were that split-grip forehands don&rsquo;t go as fast when you&rsquo;re throwing hard, and backhands have more spin when you don&rsquo;t throw them hard. The participants were grouped into &ldquo;elite&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-elite&rdquo; throwers (based on their answers to a survey, I think) but the results held for both groups. The only difference between the groups was that elite throwers can throw the disc harder. It&rsquo;s a pretty good study overall, though you have to take it with a grain of salt. The sample size was small (5 elite throwers, 11 non-elite throwers), the accuracy is pretty meaningless (the target was 2.5 meters from the thrower), and the setup was not game-like at all (the authors admit that their results could be affected by the throwers being careful to avoid hitting the expensive camera equipment). Despite that, it&rsquo;s good to see the light of science being shined on ultimate.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.leaguevine.com/blog/134/power-rankings-in-ultimate/">Power Rankings in Ultimate</a></h2>

<p>More talk about the ranking system. Being a data nerd, I love stuff like this (the winter league I run ranks teams using <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=37">this power ranking algorithm</a>, not straight results).</p>

    <h2>Day 1</h2>

<p>Had a first round bye, rolled all 3 teams in our pool. We were a lot better than I&rsquo;ve seen us play at any other tournament. Granted, the first two teams were pretty weak, but we played Muff'n Men last and beat them 13-5 (we lost to them in Sectionals pool play and then pulled out a 12-8 win in the 2-3 games). After games, we ate Thai food, chilled in the hot tub and played a poker tournament at the hotel.</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<p>We started the day playing against Ant Madness (the 4 seed). The game was a roller coaster of ups and downs. We took half 8-3, they tied it up at 9s, we went up 12-9, they closed the gap again. We managed to hold our lead until hard cap, winning 14-13. I&rsquo;d say we played pretty well for the most part. The weakest part of our game was our terrible deep shots. We often went deep to girls when there were guy defenders in the area, or put up floaters against their best deep defender. We also tried to throw at least 3 hammer hucks instead of putting up a normal huck or just swinging the disc.</p>

<p>In semis, we played Amp. This was the game I&rsquo;d been waiting for since I decided to play Termite&rsquo;s, but it didn&rsquo;t go the way I expected. We started off really really poorly, going down 5-1 or so and limping into half at 8-2. Once again, our deep game let us down as we threw floaty hucks into unfavorable situations. We also gave up a few poach Ds. To their credit, Amp played really well. They moved the disc well and their offense never seemed stagnant. We also didn&rsquo;t do good job (any job, really) of stopping their dump-swing, which is the core of their offense. In the second half, we stepped our game up, took away their dumps and matched them point for point, but it was too late by then. They won 15-9, knocking us out of nationals contention. On a positive note, I layout callahaned Butter&rsquo;s pushpass dump, thereby winning the layout D competition and a bottle of liquor from Shelley Su.</p>

<h2>Wrap Up</h2>

<p>Amp went on to win the region and take the only bid to Nationals. They mounted a huge 7-point D run in the second half to come back from an 8-5 halftime deficit and crush Ambiguously Grey. They&rsquo;ll be the only Philly team at Nationals, as GMG and Southpaw both lost very close games in their games-to-go (Southpaw lost 15-13 to Truck, GMG lost 15-11 to Hot Metal).</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s it for my run at Nationals this year. This is the first year since I started playing club that I won&rsquo;t be playing in Sarasota in October. In some ways, it was nice to take it easy this season and relax after Spinners. I don&rsquo;t feel as wiped out as I normally feel after Nationals and I&rsquo;ll be able to start training for next year a month earlier. My plan is to try to hit the gym 2-3 days a week and do a met-con workout with Diana 1-2 days a week. Plus winter league and ultisquash.</p>

<p>Winter training, here I come.</p>

<p>5 x 10 situps at the bottom, Kleaveland, 10 situps at the top.</p>

<p>Bike home.</p>

    <p>Prone to choking? Wanna make sure you don&rsquo;t rip that pull out of bounds on universe point? Here&rsquo;s a neat trick: <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2012/09/choking-pressure.aspx">squeeze your left hand into a fist</a>. A new study found that this simple move prevented players from doing poorly when the pressure was on (in their case, soccer players kicking penalty kicks in front of fans and cameras). A previous study linked the right hemisphere of your brain to superior performance in automated behaviors. The left side was linked to rumination. Therefore, the theory goes, you want less activation on your left side and more on your right when you&rsquo;re performing an action that you&rsquo;ve practiced often and that should be automatic to you. Since your right brain controls your left hand, that&rsquo;s the perfect way to. If this saves your ass at Regionals next week, you&rsquo;re welcome. Btw, not sure how well this trick works for lefties. Sorry.</p>

    <p>Biked to Penn Park and threw for a bit. I was there for about an hour and half the time was spent moving from field to field in search of unoccupied space. Between intramural sports and practicing teams, it wasn&rsquo;t easy but it was still good to go out and throw.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Haven&rsquo;t been doing much work lately (rehabbing my shoulder, plus lots of work at work), but I&rsquo;ve been reading/watching/thinking about ultimate a lot. Here&rsquo;s a great <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/zrt6u/i_am_ben_wiggins_3time_club_national_champion/">AMA from Ben Wiggins</a>. It&rsquo;s full of good advice and thoughts on the current state of ultimate and where it&rsquo;s headed. For example, here&rsquo;s an answer about handler training:</p>

<blockquote><p>Handler training: I am going to say this roughly 1 million times in my life, but it bears repeating&hellip;Throw Every Day. Steve Nash doesn&rsquo;t take days
off of shooting when he wants to improve. Tony Gwynn didn&rsquo;t have non-BP days. Heck, how many of the best Halo players ever miss a 24-hour period? If
you want to be better than last year, TED is your goal. In my best seasons, I missed 7 and 9 days of throwing in the 365 day span before Nationals.</p>

<p>Beyond that: Play something. Ultimate is fine and all, but play hoops or mini or hockey or something to work on the reactions and confidence and communication
of sports without overusing the specific Ultimate parts of your body. This probably isn&rsquo;t very different than cutters. Many years, I would use low level
winter and spring games to work on cutter-type stuff because I wouldn&rsquo;t get many chances to practice it during the year. And because it was fun.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some more advice on effective drilling:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think of continuation or flow as &lsquo;what you do while the disc is in the air between two of your teammates&rsquo;.</p>

<p>As a coach, it can be easy to focus on the whiteboard version of &lsquo;when disc moves like this, players should do this&rsquo;. What we forget is that
each of those moves is an OODA loop (look this up, it is rad). Each player needs to observe the field, orient themselves to the situation,
decide if and where to move, and then act. To coach that, you shouldn&rsquo;t be working at the birds-eye angle&hellip;you need to drill for instinct. Break
it down. If you are here, and they disc moves there, you should turn your head to see this and take 2 steps this direction. Drill ONLY that piece
before you go on. Give players the little tools to do what they need to react and use that air time.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know these things&hellip;then as a coach, your first mission is fact finding and NOT coaching. If you can&rsquo;t break it down, then you don&rsquo;t
know it enough to teach it. Describe it? Sure. Teach it? Not yet.</p>

<p>You can break these things down, though. Find out what YOU do when you are reacting correctly. Notice your feet, your head, the variables that you
use to decide. Then recreate those in drills.</p></blockquote>
