    <a class="js-collapse" itemprop="name">Leiout</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Leiout was awesome again this year. The weather was beautiful (70 and sunny each day), our team was fun and we played 8 awesome games of beach ultimate.</p>

<h2>Friday Night</h2>

<p>Met the team. It was mostly the same team as last year. For guys, we traded Jon and a few west coast pickups for DanD, Jay Walker and Bill (Steve&rsquo;s friend from Albaquerque). For girls, only Catie remained from last year. We picked up KayKay, Kelsey, Val, Jill and Holly. We all pregamed at the hotel (played Val&rsquo;s Deck game), then partied at Rustys. I was reminded just how many players from New York come to Leiout. I think it&rsquo;s because they can&rsquo;t wait for Wildwood and need a beach ultimate fix.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>We played pretty well most of the time, but ended up going 1-3. We lost at least one (maybe two) games where we were up at the end but relaxed too much and didn&rsquo;t finish strong. My throws were much better this year than last year, especially the hucks. I don&rsquo;t know what I changed, but I figured out how to throw floaty hucks out to space in front of receivers without throwing them out the back of the endzone. I still had some throwaways and stupid mistakes, but I felt pretty good overall. Max also played outstandingly. He made several very athletic grabs and skys. Turns out he&rsquo;s actually pretty good when he&rsquo;s not drunk.</p>

<h2>Sat Night</h2>

<p>Thai for dinner, more Deck, then tournament party. Compared to last year, this one was pretty lame. It had a lot of potential but they didn&rsquo;t do anything with it. The space was a large warehouse (reminds me of raves I went to in high school) with several tables/bars and one dancing crowd in front of the speakers. There was no place to sit, no games to play and no free drinks ($7 for a whiskey sour is kind of a lot). After we got bored, we went to Barnie&rsquo;s Beanery and played shufflepuck.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>We dropped down to become the 5 seed in a lower pool (I think it was F pool). We resolved to come out strong and maintain our focus, and that paid off. We won our first two games pretty easily and were up in the third, but hit a speed bump. The other team went up and had the disc in the endzone to win it, but their cutter dropped a wide-open throw for the goal. We scored, then broke them twice more for the win. It was extremely lucky, but we&rsquo;ll take it.</p>

<p>In the finals, we played a UCLA alum team. The game was close the whole time. We started up a point and took turns scoring and trading breaks. I think they were up after half but we broke them to go up one. Towards the end, we up 9-8 when Steve got a minor concussion. We scored the point to get to universe for us, but then our luck changed. They scored and we put on our universe line to end the game. We worked the disc very well, moving side to side and making steady progress up the field. We were about 10 feet from the endzone and just needed an easy goal, but Steve threw it sideways across the field and out of bounds. UCLA came back to score, then broke us twice more to seal the deal.</p>

<h2>Sun Night</h2>

<p>Lots of gyros, dinner at the Beanery, Deck, a late attempt at Rustys, Ale House, late night food search, Fuck the Dealer, more Deck.</p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<ol>
<li>Eating is super important. I felt way better after eating that fruit before finals.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t let anyone play if they have a concussion, even if its minor. They will make mistakes.</li>
</ol>

    <p>Did 3 more climbs today, including one lead.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/from-soup-to-nuts/105732239">From Soup To Nuts</a>: a nice 5.7 crack with a tricky start but then smooth sailing after that. I spent most of the time halfway in the crack, halfway on the face.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/abbey-road/105733046">Abbey Road</a>: My onsight lead, a pretty easy 5.4. It was probably too easy of a climb, but I&rsquo;m not good at leading so it was fun to practice. Plus it set us up for our next climb, which I considered leading but chickened out because it looked tough and not well protected at the start.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/fleet-street/105732299">Fleet Street</a>: A tricky 5.8R face climb. Steve and Jeremy went before me so I got some beta on how to do the start (gotta smear and mantle), so that made it easier. If I hadn&rsquo;t seen them do it, I think I would have had a much tougher time. Either way, I really liked it. It was different from the cracks we climbed before and I felt much sketchier without the clear footholds.</li>

    <p>Steve, Eddie and I climbed two routes at Calico Basin (near Las Vegas). Eddie led both routes, then Steve climbed, then I climbed and cleaned up. First, we climbed <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/v/singing-love-pen/105733040">Singing Love Pen</a>. It&rsquo;s a 5.9 and the crux is pretty tough. I got through it eventually, but not without a bit of hanging on the rope. The second route was <a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/North_America/United_States/Nevada/Red_Rock_Canyon/Calico_Basin/Moderate_Mecca/Valentine_s_Day_27439.html">Valentine&rsquo;s Day</a>, a fun 5.8 crack climb. It was tricky at parts, with one section that&rsquo;s very low on footholds, but I managed to send it on my first try. Steve also sent it, making it his first outdoor ascent.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We played the winter league season opener against Butter&rsquo;s team. We played OK in the first half, they played better. In the second half, we really started to suck. Our team is pretty tall, so the deep game should have been good, but we overthrew our receivers 3 out of 4 times (or maybe more) while our in-cuts were wide open. Our defense was also lacking. Overall, a poor showing. We lost 27-14 after being down 14-10 at half.</p>

<p>I think our team has a lot of potential. I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re the tallest team in the leage, and we definitely have the best women. We just have to reign in the deep shots (or start to aim at the front of the endzone) and step our D up, and we&rsquo;ll be crushing it. I&rsquo;m missing our next five games unless I reschedule a few, but hopefully things come together in my absence.</p>

It was pretty windy, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to doing a lot of throwing work.</p>

<p>After the workout, I biked to Sedgely and played disc golf for a 3 hours. I learned that to putt well, just throw it at the basket.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s January 1st and everyone is making resolutions for next year. I don&rsquo;t really make resolutions, but I figured this was a good time to put my workout plan into writing to help me make sure I&rsquo;m doing what I should be doing.</p>

<h2>Lifting</h2>

<p>I plan to lift 2-3 days a week, every week. Here&rsquo;s my set of exercises, grouped into &ldquo;more frequent&rdquo; and &ldquo;less frequent&rdquo; sets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Squat</li>
<li>Deadlift</li>
<li>Clean</li>
<li>Bench Press</li>
<li>Overhead Press / Push Press</li>
<li>Weighted Pullup</li>
</ul>


<!--- --->


<ul>
<li>Bent-Over Row</li>
<li>Weighted Dip</li>
<li>Front Squat</li>
<li>Overhead Squat</li>
<li>Single-leg Squat</li>
<li>Single-leg Deadlift</li>
</ul>


<p>My main goal is to squat at least twice a week. After that, I plan to do at least two lower-body exercises and two upper-body exercises each week.</p>

<h2>Met-Con</h2>

<p>I plan to do 1-2 met-con workouts a week. I&rsquo;ll probably keep these short to start (2-10 minutes) and see how it goes.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>I plan to do some focused throwing at least once a week. I may not hit this goal until the weather gets warmer. I&rsquo;ll motivate myself by getting the Amp Challenge started soon.</p>

<h2>Track &amp; Field</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a concrete goal here. Once the weather is nice I plan to do some sort of outdoor workouts, but I don&rsquo;t have any specific plans.</p>

<h2>Eating</h2>

<p>Keep doing what I&rsquo;m doing, but probably eat more.</p>

    <p>Played 3 hours of indoor at Tee&rsquo;s. We didn&rsquo;t take many breaks and played pretty hard. By the end, I was pretty beat. I played about the same way I always play: good on D and receiving, too many throwaways (some stupid decisions, some just bad throws). I always forget that hammers are a good throw indoors.</p>

    <p>While partying on Friday, I attempted and successfully did one rollout on the ab roller. Full as in &ldquo;on my toes&rdquo;. I did have a small pillow under my knees, so I think that probably helped. But that still means I&rsquo;m a lot closer to doing them than I thought.</p>

    <p>Did my first workout at the basement gym. Ashley and I did the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bench: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">10</span>@<span class="number">133</span>, <span class="number">5</span>@<span class="number">155</span>, <span class="number">4</span>@<span class="number">161</span>, <span class="number">3</span>@<span class="number">155</span> </span></li>

<li>Front Squat: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">3</span>x<span class="number">5</span>@<span class="number">133</span> </span> (each set started with a clean)</li>
</ul>


<p>The weighs are a bit weird because they are all in kilos.</p>

<p>After we finished working out, the squat rack arrived. I&rsquo;ll be putting it together soon.</p>

    <p>We&rsquo;re getting some exercise equipment to put in the basement at work. Gonna save on gym fees this year. The gym is called the Pumpatorium, and so far we have a bar, weights (in kgs) and a bench. The squat rack is on it&rsquo;s way, and then we&rsquo;ll just need a platform to lift on and we&rsquo;re pretty set for a while.</p>

<p>My first workout was a quick 4x220lb deadlift.</p>

<p>Before bed, I also did 2x20 pushups. Just for fun.</p>
