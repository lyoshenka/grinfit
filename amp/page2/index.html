    <p>Worked on many different things at practice. I was less happy with my performance this time, mostly because of the many throwing mistakes I had. There were at least 3 easy backhands that I should have completed but I just threw them away. Besides that, I played OK. The deep throwing practice was useful, and we spent most of the rest of the time scrimmaging with different formats: zone only, 1 score or 2 turns, double-score, etc.</p>

<p>After practice, Diana and I went to our summer league game. We played Satell&rsquo;s team. They were clearly lacking their top players and we picked up Mike Gentile. The game was fairly lopsided and we won handily. They had a strong deep game, but they turned it a lot and we capitalized well on most of their turns.</p>

    <p>We worked on deep throws and defense in the air, then switched to 5v5 and 6v6 scrimmage, then worked on zone (ATC and 1-3-3). All the drills felt very productive and I liked the pace. We went hard up front in the deep drills, running a good amount of sprints with little rest. Then in the scrimmages, we had enough subs to wholesale every point, so we got a good amount of rest. I felt like I was pretty much fully rested for each point. The zone work and scrimmages were pretty good, though with no wind, it tough to replicate zone conditions. I gave into throwing loopy over-the-top throws a few times even though I would not throw them in a real zone game. Still, it was good to go through the reps. We even played with an extra defender and the O still managed to score a decent number of times.</p>

<p>After watching the videos (<a href="https://vimeo.com/98890149">1</a>,<a href="https://vimeo.com/98997131">2</a>) from the 5on5 scrimmage, it&rsquo;s very clear how effective it is to make big deep cuts. Many of them either turned into goals, or became big in cuts. The big unders may be partially because of our emphasis on playing back-hip defense. I&rsquo;m curious to see how this works against teams that play underneath defense. Hopefully our throwers can punish them with deep shots.</p>

<p>After practice, we hit up Dre&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s pool for some swimming and burgers. Then I took a short nap and continued the party at Sara&rsquo;s: DIY pizza and the USvPortugal world cup game.</p>

    <p>Scrimmage at the Duck Pond. We played 4 games of 10-12 minutes. All games were 5v5 and on-the-fly subbing, but on a full field. We also added the rule that you cannot throw backwards. I played well for the most part, but had a poor flick huck again. I did have several good hucks though. I&rsquo;ll keep working on it.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today&rsquo;s practice focused mostly on training several important skills: upline cutting and defense, around backhand breaks, breaking out of a sideline trap, and the shape of our cuts. We scrimmaged a bit at the end to consolidate those skills and put them into use. I think my cuts and upline stuff was decent (though I got beat in the sideline drill once), but my throws definitely need work. Some of my around backhands are good, some were pretty bad, and my hucks are just awful overall.</p>

<p>After practice, we also got together and talked about team goals and individual goals for the season. Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>throw every day</li>
<li>you&rsquo;re doing a disservice to your teammates by not going all out in practice. we have to push each other to work harder so we know how to deal with difficult situations.</li>
<li>the best competition we&rsquo;re going to see for most of the year is ourselves.</li>
<li>season goal: stay injury-free, touch the disc every day, focus on things we can control and on constant improvement.</li>
<li>everyone needs to be a threatening player. last year we relied on Birdo to make plays and be open for us. everyone should be able to win their matchup the way Birdo did.</li>
<li>be open to receiving feedback from our teammates. we can always learn from each other. similarly, feel comfortable giving feedback to others. let the captains set the general strategy and make major corrections, but also look to help.</li>
<li>its important to build trust in each other. we should not feel inhibited in our game or our decisions because of deficiencies we perceive in others on our team. we should play our game.</li>
<li>aim high. don&rsquo;t settle for winning games or even tournaments. aim to win every point and every cut.</li>
<li>identify our own weaknesses and tailor our workouts to eliminate them.</li>
<li>besides lifting and running, we need to focus on eating and sleeping well.</li>
<li>if we&rsquo;re down 9-3, we can not change the past or control what happened. we can only focus on what we&rsquo;re going to do next. this mindset is a good way to stay positive when we&rsquo;re down without pretending to be happy.</li>
<li>think about that end-of-season talk when we&rsquo;ve played our last game at nationals. visualize us, sitting in a circle, all smelly and sunburnt, cleats and socks littering the field. what do you see us talking about? how do you want that conversation to go? now think about what you&rsquo;re going to do today to make sure that happen.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Had our first practice with the final roster. Butter was there but he had just had shoulder surgery yesterday morning so he was not 100%. I took over clapping duties and some play calling when I was in. We worked on the usual things: attacking vertically and to the break side, playing defense, etc. The main new elements were working on Sauce, getting out of a hard sideline trap, and our 3on3 redzone set. The trap work was particularly useful - we do get stuck there sometimes and its good for everyone to know how to get out. I rally enjoyed playing the thrower role (5 for 5 on goals) and also attacking upline from the dump. I also really liked marking Owen. Even though I felt that I gave up the inside break too much, the sideline was happy with the mark.</p>

<p>One thing I did not do well is swing the disc on O. There were a few times where I got caught up in moving the disc up the force side and did not look for the break soon enough. I also got stuck clogging the dump space for Zumba on one play. I thought I was open on a late bailout in cut. He didn&rsquo;t look at me (which makes sense in retrospect because he was looking at his dump) so I just stood there and called for it. I should not have been there in the first place and should have gotten out sooner.</p>

<p>After practice, I taught Papa how to do backflips on the highjump pad. I was also gonna teach Lexa but she kneed herself in the nose on her first attempt and that was the end of that.</p>

    <p>Excellent weekend of ultimate. I haven&rsquo;t won a non-playoffs tournament since Philly Invite last year. Also, I really felt like our team grew and learned a lot this weekend. We had a lot of subs on Saturday and won all our pool play games (none were very challenging). Then we lost our crossover to SHUYAMOUF because we did not defend the deeps well. We started strong, going up 5-2. Then they scored 10 points in a row. We came back some with a run of our own, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to win the game.</p>

<hr />

<p>On Sunday, all the Spinners left for their game so we were down to about 10 guys. But I liked that better because I got to play more and connect more with everyone else. We won our first game against Bang, then played Lions in semis. They took half 8-3 to start, then we got a break to go to 10-5, and then we scored 6 straight to win the game on 11-10 on hard cap. That was one of the most exciting comebacks I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of. Devlin gave a great half-time speech about wanting to feel our team from the sideline and our defense refocused to execute our gameplan. We took away the deeps and the arounds, and they collapsed. I caught a great huck from Harrison to tie it at 10s and Katie hit Ben with a hammer to win the game.</p>

<p>In the finals, we played SHUYAMOUF again. They gained their MLU players (Sean Murray and Lucas), but Amp was on fire. We started off strong and never looked back. They only beat us deep one or two times, scoring most of their goals in the front corner of the endzone or on nice IO breaks. We did slack off on taking away the arounds - will have to work on that in the future. Our ladies were especially dominant, getting several nice Ds and shutting down their assignments. In the last few points, they were completely uncovered for multiple cuts in a row. The guys also played well. Bulb caught the winning goal by walking to the throw in the enzone - there was no one even close to him.</p>

<hr />

<p>I had the honor of being named the mens MVP for the tourney for playing strong back-hip D, attacking the break side with my throws, and deciding to stop throwing my deep throws that weren&rsquo;t working. Sara got the women&rsquo;s MVP for repeatedly breaking the mark and for several heads-up Ds during the day. We celebrated with some all-natural chocolate milk and dinner at <strike>Guacamole</strike>Desi Village. Amp!</p>

    <p>The first of our regular midweek meetups. We warmed up with a bit of plyos and the give-n-go drill, then scrimmaged (5v5, then 3v3) for over an hour. It was a lot of fun. Playing with fewer players gives you way more touches and lets you feel like you&rsquo;re killing it on O because you&rsquo;re way open. On D though, its a lot tougher. I did ok for the most part. My cutting was pretty good but my deep throws were way off. Throwing higher has been helping, but now I&rsquo;m sometimes throwing too high. I guess that&rsquo;s ok for now.</p>

<p>After the game, we went to Luigi&rsquo;s Pizza in Fairmount and talked about jersey designs. I&rsquo;m starting to feel pretty good about it. They are not gonna wind up as boring as I feared.</p>

    <p>Great practice with AMP. I was a bit hurt so I didn&rsquo;t go 100% on everything, but I still played a decent amount. We worked on defense for the most part: deep D, under D, etc. There was a good amount of scrimmaging, which is always nice, and the drills were pretty fun and felt useful. Also my throwing on Friday definitely paid off because my throws were pretty good today (except when they were catastrophically bad). Especially in the away cut drill, my flicks finally had enough IO on them to stay straight in the wind. Unfortunately, it did not translate well to in-game hucks. I did have a really nice full-field huck to Diana, but it was just a bit too far :-(</p>

    <p>Another amp tryout, another injury. I think I strained my quad during warmups or the first drill or something. It feels very much like the time I messed up my right quad at OMK. But this time I&rsquo;m gonna take good care of it and not come back until I&rsquo;m ready. So I spent most of the practice watching the drills and the grames.</p>

    <p>Amp&rsquo;s first tournament of the season. I&rsquo;m still coming back from my tendonitis, so I only played half a day on Saturday. The weekend was a mix of ups and downs for me. I started off on a huge down, with two drops and three turns in our first game (which we ended up losing). The rest of the games went pretty well. We beat AG on Saturday, then won our quarters game on Sunday and lost a very close game to AG in semis. I caught a layout Callahan against AG.</p>

<p>Things I need to improve: cutting on O. My awareness is decent but needs work, especially paying attention to my teammates. I also need to learn to stop and cut faster and to throw better into the wind. Finally, fewer turns. Maybe it was just my first game outside, but the throwaways were poor decisions and that&rsquo;s no good.</p>

<p>EDIT: also got bit by a tick sometime this weekend. This might come in handy later.</p>

    <p>Played a full game against Delaware&rsquo;s college team. They were pretty athletic and had decent throws, but their girls were not great and they didn&rsquo;t have the experience we had. The game was close in the first and most of the second quarter, though it was our fault for turning over a lot of endzone opportunities. We got our shit together some more in the second half and pulled away to win by 6 or 7. I had a good amount of inside breaks for goals, but I also turned over a bunch. Butter is right, my IO flick needs work.</p>

    <a class="js-collapse" itemprop="name">Amp Meeting, Spinners Practice</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Had a long meeting about the upcoming Amp season. We talked about the importance of player retention, changing up the practice structure (midweek practices, more intense weekends, fewer but longer weekends), focusing on cutting and on-field problem solving, tryouts and setting the roster early, and many other things. It was mostly a brainstorming session as well as a feedback-for-the-captains session. There was some disagreement about early-season tournaments and whether going to a beach weekend with a bunch of people you don&rsquo;t know is a good or bad things for new players. We also talked about holding each other accountable and creating standards of fitness. Dre mentioned that every DI program she&rsquo;s ever coached or played for has fitness standards, and they are a good way to force people to get in shape, but she would not advocate them for Amp because the primary goal is not to win a championship at any cost.</p>

<p>After the meeting, we went to Spinners practice. We mostly scrimmaged and worked on dump offense and defense. I threw some good throws but also had a few bad turnovers. My D was fairly good allaround. I&rsquo;d give me a 7 out of 10. Or maybe 6. Need more work.</p>

    <p>Played against the Spinners team (the Baers, Brando, Zargham, etc). They were missing half their guys, but still gave us a great game. I don&rsquo;t think the point diff was ever more than 4, and the final score was 32-31. We won on a last-second Raha handblock and score to go up 1, then a D from Satell to seal the win.</p>

<p>I did not play very well. It was cold and my hands were freezing again, so my throws were not good. I was also pretty tired from yesterday, so my D was weak at times. Now it&rsquo;s time for a day off to prepare for Phoenix tryouts tomorrow night.</p>

    <p>Played against Roots and then Trey&rsquo;s team. We played fairly well on the whole and won both games. We were a bit savage and some of our players were sick (including me). I had a few bad throwaways but played with discipline besides that.</p>

<h2>AMP Indoor</h2>

<p>Played more amp. We spent more time focusing on cutting. Did a new drill where one cutter cuts in, catches the disc, and hits a second in-cut at an exact location. The goal is for the second cutter to time their cut so they get the disc i nstride at the correct spot. We also scrimmaged a lot.</p>

    <h2>Ultisquash</h2>

<p>Played a bunch of ultisquash in the morning. We hav enough people for two games, so we played pretty much nonstop. I was undefeated until the very last game.</p>

<h2>Amp Indoor</h2>

<p>Another great indoor session. We spent more time working on downfield cutting. One thing we did was eliminate the dump in several drills. We also worked on cutter timing and some short 3 on 3 drills. We finished with a bunch of scrimmages, throwing, rolling and dinner at Butter&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>My indoor throws have definitely been improving. Fitness is still a bit lacking, though that may be because of the ultisquash.</p>

    <p>An awesome 2 hours. We did some short stretches and drills, then scrimmaged a lot. First drill was a give-and-go drill with 3 stationary receivers and one cutter running down the middle of the field. I liked the drill, but I&rsquo;m unsure about the in-game usefulness. Going from catch to throw quickly was good practice. But when I try to do this move in a real game, the hardest part is throwing to a moving cutter while also moving.</p>

<p>After that drill and a 1-on-1 cutting in space drill, we played a bunch of scrimmages. For the first few, we were not allowed to throw the disc backwards. For the last few, it was just standard indoor ultimate with a slightly longer stall count.</p>

<p>I need to match up against Papa more.</p>

    <p>Reproduced here in it&rsquo;s full glory.</p>

<blockquote><p>AMP&rsquo;s made progress again! Meeting physical ambitions, mastering planks and maneuvering past all Mid-Atlantic predicted adversaries, making postseason annual migration pattern.</p>

<p>Aggressive marking positions and magnificent plays are making people afraid. Meanwhile, Princess and Miggs [pseudonymns] are match-up problems, and Michael Panna a major pickup, adding more potent attacks. Mustached Purifico assaults molded plastic, Andrea&rsquo;s most passionate and Melissa&rsquo;s perfect at motivating players. Adept Melanie preserves AMP&rsquo;s major possessions, and Maddie, Pelleg and Matt Paparone are massive performers. Alex&rsquo;s mammoth pulls and magical point-blocks always mystify people.</p>

<p>Allowing momentary pause, all members prepare and meticulously plan a merciless push. After mental preparation and much practicing, another mighty pool awaits mixed Philadelphians. AMP&rsquo;s mission plan: attack, make plays, achieve maximum pleasure and modern prominence.</p></blockquote>
