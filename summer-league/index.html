    <p>Played a close game against Alex Morrone&rsquo;s team. We started off slow but came back at the end to win it 16-14. I played an ok amount at
first, but then played most of the last few points to bring us back on top and take the win.</p>

<p>Straight from there, drove to Porcfest for two days of camping, LBRY and freedom.</p>

    <p>Played two games at summer league finals. We were in E/F pool and were not taking things very seriously. We played fairly well in the first game and won by a few points. In the second game, I think we came into it hoping to lose and it showed in our playing. We also let them pick up Whitney, which didn&rsquo;t help our cause. Regardless, I had fun hanging out and taking Sunday off.</p>

    <p>Played a close and intense summer league game against Norm&rsquo;s team. They have a good team - they were missing their best guy and girl and we still had a really hard time against them. Pretty much the whole game, we were within 1 or 2 points of each other. We got the first break, but they got it back a few points later. They took half 8-7 and we traded till 11-10 or so. Then we scored several breaks to bring it to 14-12, but they came back to 14s. Finally we closed the game out 15-14.</p>

<p>We played the same way we usually play - slow in the first half, then better in the second half. We did switch to a backhand force for the second half and our girls bracketed and clogged the open side more too. If only we can come out strong in the first half, we&rsquo;d have a much better record.</p>

<p>After the game, we had a great turnout at Edgely grilling. Both Pops and I had our birthdays today, and playing Norm made it even better. A lot of people from both teams came out, plus a few other teams joined our party too. There were sausages, chicken, cheesecake, pie, and plenty of beer. We didn&rsquo;t get home till after midnight.</p>

    <p>Ran a few drills with Devlin and Glazer before our game. Did the 10-cut drill 3 times, then did the triangle cutting drill (cut deep, cut under, slash break, cut deep again, all while watching the throwing and cutting off their fakes) 2 times each on the forehand and backhand side.</p>

<p>Then played all but one point in our 15-14 loss to Rosso&rsquo;s team. We played quite poorly across the board, with everyone having bad turnovers and other mistakes (Betsy dropped the pull). Yet we still managed to get a bunch of breaks and win the insanely long points we played. We went up a break at 11-10, they got the break back at 13s, and then it was universe point. We even got the D fairly close to their endzone, but could not convert. They scored for the win.</p>

<p>After the game we had a good showing at team hangout. I drank two smoothies from the smoothie truck (one before the game, one after) and ate a bunch of Paella from Bulb&rsquo;s team.</p>

    <p>A tight summer league game against Trey&rsquo;s team. We played really well in the first half were up two breaks at halftime. In the second half, we had a bunch of unforced short-field turnovers and they won 15-11. We still played solid defense, but could not overcome all the mistakes. In general, our O was strong when we didn&rsquo;t turn it early. We did a good job opening up space in the middle of the field for the players who were being left uncovered. They then worked it to each other and marched the disc up the field into the endzone. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how we did, especially considering that Jeff, Katie and Diana were not playing (though we picked up Yoli to take Diana&rsquo;s spot).</p>

    <p>Played a game against Venose &amp; Drake&rsquo;s team. Venose and Adam weren&rsquo;t there, so we went up early and didn&rsquo;t have a tough game. They came back towards the end, btu the game got rained out at 12-9 so that&rsquo;s a win for us. Was gonna do sprints or shuttles after the game, but the rain killed that.</p>

    <p>Worked on many different things at practice. I was less happy with my performance this time, mostly because of the many throwing mistakes I had. There were at least 3 easy backhands that I should have completed but I just threw them away. Besides that, I played OK. The deep throwing practice was useful, and we spent most of the rest of the time scrimmaging with different formats: zone only, 1 score or 2 turns, double-score, etc.</p>

<p>After practice, Diana and I went to our summer league game. We played Satell&rsquo;s team. They were clearly lacking their top players and we picked up Mike Gentile. The game was fairly lopsided and we won handily. They had a strong deep game, but they turned it a lot and we capitalized well on most of their turns.</p>

    <p>Our team was kinda short on guys. Our opponents were short on guys and girls. They were missing Leon and possibly another guy, so they struggled against us. We took the opportunity to work on zone (1-3-3), force backhand, and break-side cuts. We were up the whole time and won without too much of a struggle (though they were close the whole way till about halftime). After the game, Obert, TS and I threw deep throws for about 20 minutes. My flicks are getting back on track somewhat. I changed my grip a bit (moved my thumb back and toward the center). I think this gives me more spin, which helps level out hucks. After that, beers and pizza.</p>

    <p>Played a close game against a good team tonight. We were up most of the way, starting from the first break, then taking half 8-6, then being up 12-9. But then, they scored 4 in a row and ended up winning 15-13. We played solid D and O for the most part, though we didn&rsquo;t go to the break side as much as I would have liked. Our main problem was our endzone O. When we had the disc on the line, we either struggled to score or failed completely. Jeff noticed it too, so hopefully we&rsquo;ll work on it next game. We also got beat deep too many times, especially by this one girl on their team. Deep D is still a weak point for us, though our girls did a great job running switches and helping clog the lanes and the deep space. That will probably be a plus for us all season (at least when Diana and Katie are there).</p>

<p>After the game, we ran 4 sets of 5x20yd shuttles in the endzone with 60sec rest in between.</p>

    <p>Warmed up my throws with Diana and Bulb. Then played a decent game of ultimate. I threw away three hucks, all flickside. Two were short and bladey, the other was over Katie&rsquo;s head. Besides that I played well, got a bunch of Ds, and we won.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I ran the 10cut drill 5 times. I focused on figuring out my footwork, getting low on turns, and running at top speed the whole time.</p>

    <p>First summer league game of the year. We played well but got beat deep on pretty much all of their goals. Not many subs, so I played just about every point.
