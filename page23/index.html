    <a class="js-collapse" itemprop="name">Skills and Scrimmage Practice</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today&rsquo;s practice focused mostly on training several important skills: upline cutting and defense, around backhand breaks, breaking out of a sideline trap, and the shape of our cuts. We scrimmaged a bit at the end to consolidate those skills and put them into use. I think my cuts and upline stuff was decent (though I got beat in the sideline drill once), but my throws definitely need work. Some of my around backhands are good, some were pretty bad, and my hucks are just awful overall.</p>

<p>After practice, we also got together and talked about team goals and individual goals for the season. Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>throw every day</li>
<li>you&rsquo;re doing a disservice to your teammates by not going all out in practice. we have to push each other to work harder so we know how to deal with difficult situations.</li>
<li>the best competition we&rsquo;re going to see for most of the year is ourselves.</li>
<li>season goal: stay injury-free, touch the disc every day, focus on things we can control and on constant improvement.</li>
<li>everyone needs to be a threatening player. last year we relied on Birdo to make plays and be open for us. everyone should be able to win their matchup the way Birdo did.</li>
<li>be open to receiving feedback from our teammates. we can always learn from each other. similarly, feel comfortable giving feedback to others. let the captains set the general strategy and make major corrections, but also look to help.</li>
<li>its important to build trust in each other. we should not feel inhibited in our game or our decisions because of deficiencies we perceive in others on our team. we should play our game.</li>
<li>aim high. don&rsquo;t settle for winning games or even tournaments. aim to win every point and every cut.</li>
<li>identify our own weaknesses and tailor our workouts to eliminate them.</li>
<li>besides lifting and running, we need to focus on eating and sleeping well.</li>
<li>if we&rsquo;re down 9-3, we can not change the past or control what happened. we can only focus on what we&rsquo;re going to do next. this mindset is a good way to stay positive when we&rsquo;re down without pretending to be happy.</li>
<li>think about that end-of-season talk when we&rsquo;ve played our last game at nationals. visualize us, sitting in a circle, all smelly and sunburnt, cleats and socks littering the field. what do you see us talking about? how do you want that conversation to go? now think about what you&rsquo;re going to do today to make sure that happen.</li>
</ul>

    <a class="js-collapse" itemprop="name">First AMP Practice After Cuts</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Had our first practice with the final roster. Butter was there but he had just had shoulder surgery yesterday morning so he was not 100%. I took over clapping duties and some play calling when I was in. We worked on the usual things: attacking vertically and to the break side, playing defense, etc. The main new elements were working on Sauce, getting out of a hard sideline trap, and our 3on3 redzone set. The trap work was particularly useful - we do get stuck there sometimes and its good for everyone to know how to get out. I rally enjoyed playing the thrower role (5 for 5 on goals) and also attacking upline from the dump. I also really liked marking Owen. Even though I felt that I gave up the inside break too much, the sideline was happy with the mark.</p>

<p>One thing I did not do well is swing the disc on O. There were a few times where I got caught up in moving the disc up the force side and did not look for the break soon enough. I also got stuck clogging the dump space for Zumba on one play. I thought I was open on a late bailout in cut. He didn&rsquo;t look at me (which makes sense in retrospect because he was looking at his dump) so I just stood there and called for it. I should not have been there in the first place and should have gotten out sooner.</p>

<p>After practice, I taught Papa how to do backflips on the highjump pad. I was also gonna teach Lexa but she kneed herself in the nose on her first attempt and that was the end of that.</p>

    <p>Played a solid bunch of goalty at edgely. We managed to plays 4s the whole time and even had subs for most of the games. Colin and Z showed up late and added some more oomph to our games. After games, we ate some PADA pork and beer (spring league finals were going on at the same time) and headed home. On the whole I played pretty well - got a lot of Ds and scored a bunch. But I also threw away so many. Colin played really well and had almost no turnovers.</p>

    <p>3 sets of 4-5 reps of exercises and sprints. One rep is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>do 10-20 reps of an exercise</li>
<li>sprint from the start to the 25yd line, then back to the 15yd line, then to the 40</li>
<li>rest while your partner does what you just did</li>

<p>We did 5 reps the first two times, then cut it down to 4 for the last set. Our erexcises were:</p>

<ul>
<li>20 3-yard lateral shuffles</li>
<li>20 seconds moving plank</li>
<li>20 scissor jumps</li>
<li>15 full-body situps</li>
<li>20 squats (skipped these on the last set)</li>
</ul>


<p>We took about 5 min between each set to rest and do some focused throwing. We also threw for about 15 min afterwards. I worked on tired throwing and also on my leftie roaster throw. Dan pointed out that I should try to throw it inside out because that how I&rsquo;d probably use it in a game.</p>

    <p>Excellent weekend of ultimate. I haven&rsquo;t won a non-playoffs tournament since Philly Invite last year. Also, I really felt like our team grew and learned a lot this weekend. We had a lot of subs on Saturday and won all our pool play games (none were very challenging). Then we lost our crossover to SHUYAMOUF because we did not defend the deeps well. We started strong, going up 5-2. Then they scored 10 points in a row. We came back some with a run of our own, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to win the game.</p>

<hr />

<p>On Sunday, all the Spinners left for their game so we were down to about 10 guys. But I liked that better because I got to play more and connect more with everyone else. We won our first game against Bang, then played Lions in semis. They took half 8-3 to start, then we got a break to go to 10-5, and then we scored 6 straight to win the game on 11-10 on hard cap. That was one of the most exciting comebacks I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of. Devlin gave a great half-time speech about wanting to feel our team from the sideline and our defense refocused to execute our gameplan. We took away the deeps and the arounds, and they collapsed. I caught a great huck from Harrison to tie it at 10s and Katie hit Ben with a hammer to win the game.</p>

<p>In the finals, we played SHUYAMOUF again. They gained their MLU players (Sean Murray and Lucas), but Amp was on fire. We started off strong and never looked back. They only beat us deep one or two times, scoring most of their goals in the front corner of the endzone or on nice IO breaks. We did slack off on taking away the arounds - will have to work on that in the future. Our ladies were especially dominant, getting several nice Ds and shutting down their assignments. In the last few points, they were completely uncovered for multiple cuts in a row. The guys also played well. Bulb caught the winning goal by walking to the throw in the enzone - there was no one even close to him.</p>

<hr />

<p>I had the honor of being named the mens MVP for the tourney for playing strong back-hip D, attacking the break side with my throws, and deciding to stop throwing my deep throws that weren&rsquo;t working. Sara got the women&rsquo;s MVP for repeatedly breaking the mark and for several heads-up Ds during the day. We celebrated with some all-natural chocolate milk and dinner at <strike>Guacamole</strike>Desi Village. Amp!</p>

    <p>The first of our regular midweek meetups. We warmed up with a bit of plyos and the give-n-go drill, then scrimmaged (5v5, then 3v3) for over an hour. It was a lot of fun. Playing with fewer players gives you way more touches and lets you feel like you&rsquo;re killing it on O because you&rsquo;re way open. On D though, its a lot tougher. I did ok for the most part. My cutting was pretty good but my deep throws were way off. Throwing higher has been helping, but now I&rsquo;m sometimes throwing too high. I guess that&rsquo;s ok for now.</p>

<p>After the game, we went to Luigi&rsquo;s Pizza in Fairmount and talked about jersey designs. I&rsquo;m starting to feel pretty good about it. They are not gonna wind up as boring as I feared.</p>

<p>Then Bulb and I threw for about 20 min. My mid-range throws are coming along nicely but I still have a bad tendency to throw them too low. Need to aim higher, even if it seems weird to me. My deep throws were not great, prolly because I was tired and not very focused. Scoober is coming along nicely - need to not throw so far from my body and need to think about throwing it into a trash can.</p>

    <p>Great practice with AMP. I was a bit hurt so I didn&rsquo;t go 100% on everything, but I still played a decent amount. We worked on defense for the most part: deep D, under D, etc. There was a good amount of scrimmaging, which is always nice, and the drills were pretty fun and felt useful. Also my throwing on Friday definitely paid off because my throws were pretty good today (except when they were catastrophically bad). Especially in the away cut drill, my flicks finally had enough IO on them to stay straight in the wind. Unfortunately, it did not translate well to in-game hucks. I did have a really nice full-field huck to Diana, but it was just a bit too far :-(</p>

    <p>Another amp tryout, another injury. I think I strained my quad during warmups or the first drill or something. It feels very much like the time I messed up my right quad at OMK. But this time I&rsquo;m gonna take good care of it and not come back until I&rsquo;m ready. So I spent most of the practice watching the drills and the grames.</p>

<p>20 seconds ice-cold shower.</p>

    <p>Went to penn park with Diana to try out our new cleats and throw for a bit. We ended up picking up with some people who were playing there. The game was very low-level - no stalls, no calls, no real defense. But it was a great way to try out all the cleats I brought and it&rsquo;s always fun to run around and chase some plastic.</p>
