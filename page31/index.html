    <p>Crushed Regionals this weekend. We had a fairly easy Saturday, winning our pools games by a lot. We played Ant Madness in semis and had a close first half (8-6), but only gave up 1 point in the second half to win 15-7. Our finals was Sunday at 1, where we played Ambiguously Grey. We started the game with 3 straight breaks, took half 8-5 and won 14-8.</p>

<p>I played well for the most part on Saturday. I had 2 turnovers on hucks up the break side. Both were good decisions and almost good throws, but one was just a bit out of bounds and the second was a litte too floaty and let the defender catch up. I also got beat deep by Zach Weiss because I didn&rsquo;t put my head down and get in front of him on the huck. And I got rocked deep off a pull play against AG because I came too hard to try to stop the under and I was coming directly in when my guy turned and ran directly deep. If I&rsquo;m gonna stay deep off the pull, I have to not bite on the in cut so hard.</p>

<p>One seed at nationals in 15 days.</p>

    <p>Played the Penn State team again. We were savage to start, but a few more guys showed up after we began. The first half was close with one or two breaks for both teams. We took half 8-6. In the second half, we opened with a goal and then 4 or 5 breaks in a row, then finished out strong. I don&rsquo;t think our O was incredibly strong, but on D they kept throwing us the disc and we converted our second-half breaks quickly.</p>

    <p>Played a fun and really close game against the &ldquo;Amp&rdquo; team (Butter &amp; co). We were up the whole game, but never by more than one or two. In the end it came down to universe point, and we gave up the break to lose it. We played well about 80% of the time. Our D was good and we generated a lot of turns. But on O, we had trouble moving the disc to the break side and our handler movement was not great. Our stack also tended to get caught deep, which made cutting difficult. I got several Ds (at least 3, +1 shadow D) and played well for the most part. I felt pretty quick and in the zone. However, I missed several D opportunities and turned over at least two throws. One was a dumb dumb turn where I got stuck looking at Frankie in the endzone. More mental toughness!</p>

    <p>Last practice before regionals. Worked on transition offense, fitness and marks. Played a few games focusing on transition offense, then played a game to 3 where you can only score if you didn&rsquo;t start on O. Finished with a flick-huck drill.
Lunch at Circles was delicious.</p>

    <p>4 hours of practice at Ballfields. I played offense most of the time, which was a nice change. I think I played pretty well, though I had two back-to-back turnovers that should have both been easy goals. Besides that, I did a reasonably good job cutting, throwing and scoring. Raha even said she felt I played well.</p>

<p>I think the O line won one double-score scrimmage out of three (though we won it 4-0) and also won the first red zone to 10.</p>

    <p>Tonight was the first game of Competitive Fall League. Cotton Mouth&#8482; represented well. We were a bit short on players (7 guys, 5 girls) but we came out strong and closed stronger. Penn State let us go up two breaks right off the bat, then got em back to take half 8-7. We started the half with three straight breaks and then got three or four in a row to win the game 15-11. I expected more of a fight from the other team, but this makes me optimistic about the season.</p>

<p>Katie and I also did a bunch of AMPs during the game and I did a few more at home to bring it up to 50.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A fun and useful weekend of practices, beach play and hanging out. The schedule:</p>

<p>Friday night: fishbowl charades game.</p>

<p>Saturday morning: Grass practice. We worked on dumps to the open side, then redzone offense, then scrimmage. My ankle held up pretty well throughout, though its not 100% yet. Offense won the first scrimmage, defense won the second.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon: Beach practice. Playing in the wind and on the sand was great. We did a breakmark drill and the Petter drill. The wind really added a new level of difficulty. Then we split into 3 teams and played a round-robin tournament with the non-playing team doing Jamals, agility and throwing drills while the other teams played 4 on 4.</p>

<p>Sunday night: pool, grilling, crossdressing, psychiatrist, football via Apple TV.</p>

<p>Sunday morning: Back to grass. Did a Jackpot drill for vert stack and ho stack, then a bunch of O vs D scrimmaging, then a breakmark throwing/marking drill, and one final scrimmage. I started doing drills but sat out for all of the scrimmages at first. Then I got back in for the second drill and played the last game to 5. My ankle still needs time off. Major icing and ibu still needed. Also got my captain feedback: I need to get faster.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon: more pool, hoagies, Space Jam.</p>

    <p>Had a pretty good Amp turnout at Penn Park tonight. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to do much except throw and do pushups, but my ankle held up pretty well. I did most of the agility drills (T-drill, sprint-and-backpedal-in-a-box drill) but stopped towards the end. Insted I ran several 40yd sprints, working on looking for the disc and then putting my head down to run.</p>

<p>After the agility work, we switched to the hunger drill. I could do that fine because its just running in a straight line, though my ankle was not happy towards the end. We finished with 25 AMPs and some more throwing.</p>

    <p>Amp practice 9am-1pm. I rolled my ankle at about 9:30, so I spent most of the time watching and icing. It was a good practice. We worked on proper swing/continue cutting and applied that in redzone offense. This is one of my weak points so I wish I hadn&rsquo;t hurt myself because I needed the reps. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be ready by Wednesday.</p>

<p>Did 50 AMPs throughout the day and then 20 more with everyone at the end.</p>
