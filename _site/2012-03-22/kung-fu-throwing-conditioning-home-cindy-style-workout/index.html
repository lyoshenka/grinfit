  <h1>Kung Fu Throwing + Conditioning, Home Cindy-style Workout</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Yesterday: Spinners track workout at Temple. I still can&#39;t run, so Glazer and I did Parts 1 and 2 of Kung Fu Throwing. I liked part 1 but thought that part 2 was too short. That&#39;s the part that I need the most work on, but it has very few throws. I think I&#39;d double or triple that part next time. Then we did the typical Spinners conditioning (push ups, squats, abs).</p>

<p>Today: AMRAP in 20 min: 5 pull ups, 5 knees to elbows, 5 push ups. I got 13 rounds with about 3 seconds to spare.</p>
