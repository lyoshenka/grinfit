  <h1>Recap of Last Week</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Tuesday: Won a core league game against Ted's team</p>

<p>Thursday: Won a full league game against the Drexel team, then lost a game to TKO</p>

<p>Saturday: Lei-out. Beat Rocktapus Prime on universe, lost to a serious team, wrecked a weak team, lost our crossover to a fairly decent but not unbeatable team.</p>

<p>Sunday: Lei-out again. Won our first game, beat Massive Rooster on universe with three straight breaks (though I think we took half 7-4), beat Rocktapus Prime on universe again, lost in the finals (though we could have won if we played a tighter rotation).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lessons from Lei-out: hucking deep is extremely effective.</p>
