   <title>Spinners vs RI</title>

   <id>http://grinfit.alexgr.in/2012-07-21/spinners-vs-ri</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last game of the regular season. We beat RI 29-20 or something like that. They only brought 12 guys, so they weren't taking this game seriously. We only played man on D because we didn't want to give away our defenses before the playoffs game. Overall, we played pretty well. We had trouble getting the disc off the sideline sometimes. Personally, I had a layout D and a blade for a goal in the same point, along with one or two caught goals. I played pretty well but got beat up the line and to the force-side cone a few times. Need to improve in those respects. I also had an up-line throw to Harrison that got Ded but he caught it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the spinners game, Sean and I went to watch Termite's play their last game of the day at Philly Invite. They looked pretty sloppy, but that's to be expected of a new team with many of their top players not there. They went 0-4 on the day, but I saw some good plays from a few players, so I'm excited for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spinners Sprints, Tape and Gym</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Sprints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8x20m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6x40m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4x60m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x80m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Suicides&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5x 10m, 10m back, 20m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4x 10m, 10m back, 30m, walk back to the line, 30m back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Each set of sprints and suicides was immediately followed by 1 minute of throwing and 2 minutes of rest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tape&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watched the 3rd and 4th quarter of the Detroit game. Our D was fairly solid and we often got them stuck where we wanted them, but too often we let them out at the last second (typically on an in-cut or an up-line cut).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gym&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleans: 2x155lb, 2x155lb, 3x135lb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ben says I don't use my hips enough on cleans.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From Indy, we went to Lexington, KY to play the Revolution. They were missing their best player and looked weak overall. We won 27-17. I played a good amount, especially at the end when we were up a lot. Again, no turns but no Ds (though we got several team Ds from our wolf). I scored two goals and cut fairly well most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the game, we showered (well, hosed off) and hung out at the bar waiting for our bus. We played two games of Mafia (the first had 25 people) and I won both of them (as mafia the first time, and as a townsperson the second time). Boom!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spinners Track and Practice</title>
   <link href="http://grinfit.alexgr.in/2012-07-11/spinners-track-and-practice"/>
   <updated>2012-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://grinfit.alexgr.in/2012-07-11/spinners-track-and-practice</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Track&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warmup: jog the curves, accelerate to a sprint over the first 50m of the straightaway, decelerate back to a jog over the last 50m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5x200m, 2 min rest between sprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 min rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x Whistle drill (described below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 min rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4x40m, 15 sec rest between sprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Whistle Drill&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start jogging. When you hear the whistle, sprint. When you hear the next whistle, jog. Repeat. When you hear a long whistle, the person at the front of the pack starts jogging in place. Everyone else jogs to where they are and keeps jogging in place there. On the next whistle, everyone's back to sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interval between whistles is between 3 and 12 seconds (random). Each rep was a full lap (400m). I think we did about 5 or 6 sprints total. The rule for jogging is that your arms cannot fall below your waist and your feet have to come up to your shins on each step (no baby-stepping).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start off with hunger drill, with each person taking turns throwing and the offense has to catch with both hands. Did backhands and flicks. Then moved on to scrimmage for 5 pulls. The D worked on zone-to-man for the first 5 pulls, then ran wolf for the next 5 (from a standstill). O and D took turns going through wolf. I honestly think the O did it better. They run a diamond in the backfield and do more switching than we do. After wolf, we played a 5 min game that went into overtime, then sudden death. The D got a turn and worked it up, but we turned it over on the goal line (I threw a dump over Panna's head). Then O scored.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The whole team paid the piper at practice. Lots of pushups, planks, squats, 'sun gods' (hold your arms straight out, palms up), and jogging in lockstep. Then we worked on defending upline cuts on the dump (force them in, if they go behind you then turn towards the disc and use your arms to feel where they go) and baiting an IO to the front of the stack. We also worked on communicating on our cuts so we don't have timing issues. Then we watched film for an hour at Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to running the numbers on the AUDL games. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=37&quot;&gt;this algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. The results are almost the same as the win-loss standings, but take a look at Indy vs Columbus (and also Bluegrass). They are very close in RRI (the &lt;em&gt;Final Score&lt;/em&gt; column), but Columbus is ranked much lower in win-loss. In fact, Columbus has the same record as Rhode Island, which is ranked far below them in RRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RRI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We lost a super close game to Detroit. They were up the whole time, but never by more than 3 or so. We came back to tie it up late in the 4th, but couldn't hold onto it. I didn't play much, but I was mostly happy with my game. I scored once, but also missed a D that I probably should have had and also got burned deep off a foul (though Art bailed me out).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Played in Buffalo against the Hunters. We jumped out to an early lead and won the game in every way. Their offense struggled (even with John Hassel) and their D only scored one or two breaks. We had 16 total turnovers the whole game, just missing our target of 14. Personally I think this was my best game so far (maybe tied with the first game in RI). 1 goal, 1 assist, 2 Ds, no turns. Also I was cutting very well, not rushing the cuts and waiting for the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Went to Southpaw tryouts. We warmed up and ran through the baseball drill. Then we split into four teams and played a round-robin with games to 8. Wirst game, I played fairly well on d but threw a bunch of turns. Second and third game, no bad turns and a lot of caught goals. I did have one turn on a huck to Christian, but it was a good look and if I'd put a bit more distance on it, it would have been a goal. The real lesson, though, is that I usually cut too frantically. I did a lot better when I waited for my turn and set up real cuts than when I just ran around all the time. I think with all this time on defense, I'm forgetting how to play O.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Not To Choke</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/frontal-cortex/2012/06/the-new-neuroscience-of-choking.html&quot;&gt;Interesting article&lt;/a&gt; on the science of choking. Here's how to avoid it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you're proficient, don't think about specific mechanics of the motion you're making. Instead, think about general adjectives or goals. For example, think &quot;I want an outside-in huck to the middle of the endzone&quot;, not &quot;I need to snap my wrist hard&quot;. Specifics are for practice, and the goal of practice is to encode the motion in muscle memory so you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; think about it during the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't forget to have fun. When you stop having fun, you start to think too much, and that's when you choke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We ended up winning by 3 but I think it was our worst game yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had two turnovers (one to Leon in the end one that popped up from the wind, one on a fast break with 5 seconds left in the quarter when I rushed a throw). I also threw one assist. Very mediocre in general. I was close on everything but no Ds.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're on the road again this weekend, this time in Connecticut at their home opener. We played fairly well, but were behind the whole game and lost 29-23. We played well for the most part but our offense struggled and our defense didn't get enough turns back. The goal was to guard the unders and force their throwers to throw bad hucks against straight-up marks. We did that pretty well, but they ended up catching a lot of bad deep shots, sometimes even after we got a hand on the disc. We also didn't cover the incuts as well as we should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I had one layout d and another jump d that didn't go far and got caught. Also, a turn on a dishie pass against a zone. I didn't get burned much on D (a few in cuts) and played well on dumps. I'd say my biggest problem was not pulling the trigger on a few bids. Gotta be a bit more aggressive (also more physical till the refs call it). And I could always be in better shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents came out to watch the game, take some pictures, and take me out for sushi after. Also saw a few old friends: people from college and Dono (hey buddy - you're this blog's only reader).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conditioning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various exercises. Pushups, tuck jumps, burpees, plank pushups, hip planks, scissor jumps, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

It glides better but wants to go more left than the Shark. I had some nice drives but my putts still suck. That's by far the weakest part of my game. On the plus side, I hit the chains on 21 from the red on my first throw. I actually think it went in and bounced out, so that's the closest I've come to a hole-in-one (also my first birdie from red).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Game vs RI Rampage</title>
   <link href="http://grinfit.alexgr.in/2012-04-28/game-vs-ri-rampage"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Woke up at 4:30am to drive to RI for our first away game. Bus ride was pretty fun. Dustin knows a LOT of puzzle games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game was a lot of fun. The weather was way better than expected. It got cold after dark, but it was &lt;em&gt;I need a long-sleeve shirt&lt;/em&gt; cold, not &lt;em&gt;40 and raining&lt;/em&gt; cold as predicted. There was a bit of wind, but nothing serious. The game went about the same as our last two games. We started off playing pretty poorly, got better in the middle, and owned at the end. We had at least 5 drops in the first quarter and could not figure out how ultimate works. The cold may have had something to do with it. In the second and third quarter, we got our shit together. In the last quarter, we killed it. Final score was 30-22 us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I had no turns, caught and threw a goal, and had several Ds including a full-extension layout catchblock on an in-cut. I got bumped up to D1 for the second half, so I guess I was playing good D all around. My O on the turn was lacking though. I moved the disc well but missed at least one good huck-for-a-goal opportunity and could have thrown a better huck in a similar situation later on. I think we're working on D-line O for our next practice, so that should be good. As a team, the main adjustment we made was to force backhand (mostly because of Muffin) and to force their two main cutters under. They tried to huck it deep anyway and we got a ton of Ds, at least one in every two deep shots.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spinners Gym and Film Session</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Part 1 - Gym&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did a bunch of things that we usually do, but modified it somewhat to account for my own gym yesterday. Here are the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlift: 5/235lb, 5/245lb, 5/255lb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull ups: 4,4,3/35lb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press: 3x10/20lb dumbbells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I need to come up with a consistent format for listing my rounds/sets/reps. Then write an extension for Markdown to parse that and make it look nice (and easier to export later if I need to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 2 - Film&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watched the first 3 quarters of our game vs CT. Very instructive. I learned that I do a good job of staying with my man and of executing the mark we practice, but I need to adjust more for the other team's known deep threats. I got burned deep by Korber because I was fronting him (as practiced) when I should have adjusted and pushed him under. Also, I still need to figure out how to guard dumps better. I'm starting to realized that there are more nuances to dump defense than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Squats: 5/185lb, 5/165lb, 6/165lb (worked on my form and keeping my weight on my heels)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dips: 6,6,7/60lb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power Cleans: 3x6/125lb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Did dips and cleans together (alternating sets) because  we were late for disc golf.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disc Golf&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the gym, went played 36 holes at Sedgely (18 blue, 18 yellow). Did not do so well on the blues, but played a lot better on the yellows. Cuatro and I beat Norm and Reznick. I lost my Shark, but bought a Comet (supposed to be just like a Shark but a bit faster and glidier). We'll see how that works out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Practice 8-11am, then Game vs. CTC</title>
   <link href="http://grinfit.alexgr.in/2012-04-21/spinners-vs-ct"/>
   <updated>2012-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://grinfit.alexgr.in/2012-04-21/spinners-vs-ct</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spent most of the morning practice working on marks. Here's the plan: flash for one full second, then 0, then 10, then no-around at 3-4 seconds. The no-around is 100 degrees, but think of it as a 10 mark but rotated 90 degrees. You still have to stop the IO, but only allow the dump to go directly backwards. As for guarding the dump, when the dump is on the open side, force them upfield (the no-around mark won't be very helpful here, so force the harder throw). When the dump is on the break side,  do NOT give up the upline (mark is allowing it) and force them directly back. When they are back there, give them 2-3 feet of cushion to bait the floaty dump, then get the D. Make sure to play close if the dump is even with or in front of the disc to prevent the IO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After practice and a nap, played against CTC. We won 22-16 but I did not play well (or play much; only 5-6 points or so). I overthrew Dustin in the endzone once and threw a Ben a throw that I should not have (his defender was fouling him but he was still close and it was not a good choice). I also let Korber beat me deep, won't let that happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

I sat out the first half but started to play in the second half. We were down 5 late in the game, but then we threw the Trey zone and evened up the score. We couldn't pull ahead and ended up losing by 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I went to Spinners tryouts. We did the beep test, breakmark drill, hunger drill and 40 meter survivor sprints. We also scrimmaged a lot. In the end, I made the team. Expect a lot of &quot;spinners practice&quot; posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tied Brose's core team 20-20, then did 10 burpees, pistols, push ups and
full-body crunches. I played well in the first half, esp on D, but threw
away a LOT in the second half. Mostly deep throws to people covered by H or

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Saturday: 3.5 hours of Spinners tryouts. It was windy and cold, but that didn't bother me too much after warmups. It's hard for me to tell how I did compared to anyone. I was top ten in the beep test, but otherwise we were broken up into groups and it looked like just about everyone played decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday: Beat Trey's WL core team 20-19. Trey wasn't there, but the game was still close. We should have won by more because we were up 8-1 in the first quarter, but then really slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wednesday: Disc golf at Sedgely. I played really well on the front 18. I was -2 for a long time and finished -1. I've never even hit par before. The back back 9 went worse than usual, but we played the reds so that's to be expected. I think I was +3 for the back back (compared to -5 from the yellows the time before, but that was probably a major fluke).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday: Dodgeball playoffs. We're in the 5 through 8 bracket. I don't know what seed we are, but we won 7-3 last night so we're playing the 5v6 game next Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/14 - WL Full loss to Butter's team. We each had 6 guys and we both played well. We were up most of the game but died at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/17 - Air Force WOD. Did it in 11:50 with 65lb barbell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/16 - WL Full loss to RABS. We once again had 6 guys. They had their full team. They crushed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/19 - WL Core win against Alex Peters (27-21)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thursday: Lost 7-0 in dodgeball to the defending champions. I guess they are the champs for a reason. At least two of the games ended with me alone against all 6 of them. Both times, I got a few out but then got hit. On the plus side, I came up with a pretty interesting (though kinda cheesy) strategy. Gonna save it till the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we lost to Butter's full team on Thursday. We had the game and were up a few in the third quarter. They scored 5 or 6 in a row, and then we lost by 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full: our O is still having problems. We threw into a lot of poaches and made dumb mistakes. We're also still taking too long to sub.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday: Won a full league game against the Drexel team, then lost a game to TKO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday: Lei-out. Beat Rocktapus Prime on universe, lost to a serious team, wrecked a weak team, lost our crossover to a fairly decent but not unbeatable team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday: Lei-out again. Won our first game, beat Massive Rooster on universe with three straight breaks (though I think we took half 7-4), beat Rocktapus Prime on universe again, lost in the finals (though we could have won if we played a tighter rotation).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons from Lei-out: hucking deep is extremely effective.&lt;/p&gt;
