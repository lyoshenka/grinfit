  <h1>Spinners Tryout and Winter League</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Saturday: 3.5 hours of Spinners tryouts. It was windy and cold, but that didn&#39;t bother me too much after warmups. It&#39;s hard for me to tell how I did compared to anyone. I was top ten in the beep test, but otherwise we were broken up into groups and it looked like just about everyone played decent.</p>

<p>Sunday: Beat Trey&#39;s WL core team 20-19. Trey wasn&#39;t there, but the game was still close. We should have won by more because we were up 8-1 in the first quarter, but then really slowed down.</p>
