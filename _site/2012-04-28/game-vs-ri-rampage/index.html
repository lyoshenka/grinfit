  <h1>Game vs RI Rampage</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Woke up at 4:30am to drive to RI for our first away game. Bus ride was pretty fun. Dustin knows a LOT of puzzle games.</p>

<p>The game was a lot of fun. The weather was way better than expected. It got cold after dark, but it was <em>I need a long-sleeve shirt</em> cold, not <em>40 and raining</em> cold as predicted. There was a bit of wind, but nothing serious. The game went about the same as our last two games. We started off playing pretty poorly, got better in the middle, and owned at the end. We had at least 5 drops in the first quarter and could not figure out how ultimate works. The cold may have had something to do with it. In the second and third quarter, we got our shit together. In the last quarter, we killed it. Final score was 30-22 us.</p>

<p>Personally, I had no turns, caught and threw a goal, and had several Ds including a full-extension layout catchblock on an in-cut. I got bumped up to D1 for the second half, so I guess I was playing good D all around. My O on the turn was lacking though. I moved the disc well but missed at least one good huck-for-a-goal opportunity and could have thrown a better huck in a similar situation later on. I think we're working on D-line O for our next practice, so that should be good. As a team, the main adjustment we made was to force backhand (mostly because of Muffin) and to force their two main cutters under. They tried to huck it deep anyway and we got a ton of Ds, at least one in every two deep shots.</p>
