  <h1><a class="js-collapse">Spinners vs RI</a></h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden">
    <p>Last game of the regular season. We beat RI 29-20 or something like that. They only brought 12 guys, so they weren't taking this game seriously. We only played man on D because we didn't want to give away our defenses before the playoffs game. Overall, we played pretty well. We had trouble getting the disc off the sideline sometimes. Personally, I had a layout D and a blade for a goal in the same point, along with one or two caught goals. I played pretty well but got beat up the line and to the force-side cone a few times. Need to improve in those respects. I also had an up-line throw to Harrison that got Ded but he caught it anyway.</p>

<p>After the spinners game, Sean and I went to watch Termite's play their last game of the day at Philly Invite. They looked pretty sloppy, but that's to be expected of a new team with many of their top players not there. They went 0-4 on the day, but I saw some good plays from a few players, so I'm excited for the future.</p>
