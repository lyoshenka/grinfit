    <p>We're on the road again this weekend, this time in Connecticut at their home opener. We played fairly well, but were behind the whole game and lost 29-23. We played well for the most part but our offense struggled and our defense didn't get enough turns back. The goal was to guard the unders and force their throwers to throw bad hucks against straight-up marks. We did that pretty well, but they ended up catching a lot of bad deep shots, sometimes even after we got a hand on the disc. We also didn't cover the incuts as well as we should have.</p>

<p>Personally I had one layout d and another jump d that didn't go far and got caught. Also, a turn on a dishie pass against a zone. I didn't get burned much on D (a few in cuts) and played well on dumps. I'd say my biggest problem was not pulling the trigger on a few bids. Gotta be a bit more aggressive (also more physical till the refs call it). And I could always be in better shape.</p>

<p>My parents came out to watch the game, take some pictures, and take me out for sushi after. Also saw a few old friends: people from college and Dono (hey buddy - you're this blog's only reader).</p>
