    <p>Did a gym workout with the team at our sponsor gym in Broomall. Not my typical workout, lots of repeated stuff (squats, leg press, upside down leg press) and isolation stuff (curls, tricep pulldown, calf raises), but it was kinda cool. I also did 101 sit ups in a row.</p>

    <p>Yesterday: Spinners track workout at Temple. I still can't run, so Glazer and I did Parts 1 and 2 of Kung Fu Throwing. I liked part 1 but thought that part 2 was too short. That's the part that I need the most work on, but it has very few throws. I think I'd double or triple that part next time. Then we did the typical Spinners conditioning (push ups, squats, abs).</p>

<p>Today: AMRAP in 20 min: 5 pull ups, 5 knees to elbows, 5 push ups. I got 13 rounds with about 3 seconds to spare.</p>

    <p>Played two games in winter league finals. First game was against Keg/Kuhfuss. We were up the whole game but I got hurt in the 3rd quarter (evertion ankle sprain) and we only won by one point. Next we played Laarz. I sat out the first half but started to play in the second half. We were down 5 late in the game, but then we threw the Trey zone and evened up the score. We couldn't pull ahead and ended up losing by 1.</p>

<p>After that, I went to Spinners tryouts. We did the beep test, breakmark drill, hunger drill and 40 meter survivor sprints. We also scrimmaged a lot. In the end, I made the team. Expect a lot of "spinners practice" posts.</p>

    <p>Thursday: WL</p>

<p>Lost to Butter's team in full for the third time this season. We played
really well, especially on D, but still lost. That puts us tied for 5th
with Drexel and TKO.</p>

<p>Friday: Gym</p>

Push Press 5/95,5/115,5/115lb

<p>Saturday: Ultisquash</p>

<p>Sunday: WL</p>

<p>Tied Brose's core team 20-20, then did 10 burpees, pistols, push ups and
full-body crunches. I played well in the first half, esp on D, but threw
away a LOT in the second half. Mostly deep throws to people covered by H or
bad up-line throws.</p>

    <p>Saturday: 3.5 hours of Spinners tryouts. It was windy and cold, but that didn't bother me too much after warmups. It's hard for me to tell how I did compared to anyone. I was top ten in the beep test, but otherwise we were broken up into groups and it looked like just about everyone played decent.</p>

<p>Sunday: Beat Trey's WL core team 20-19. Trey wasn't there, but the game was still close. We should have won by more because we were up 8-1 in the first quarter, but then really slowed down.</p>

    <p>Wednesday: Disc golf at Sedgely. I played really well on the front 18. I was -2 for a long time and finished -1. I've never even hit par before. The back back 9 went worse than usual, but we played the reds so that's to be expected. I think I was +3 for the back back (compared to -5 from the yellows the time before, but that was probably a major fluke).</p>

<p>Yesterday: Dodgeball playoffs. We're in the 5 through 8 bracket. I don't know what seed we are, but we won 7-3 last night so we're playing the 5v6 game next Thursday.</p>

    <p>Tied Trey's team 19-19 today. I wanted to win, but I'm very happy with how we played today. Faster subbing, better D, better (though at times still shaky) offense, more blades, more glory. Btw, my score in the "Ds minus turns" game with Diana is still 0. She's at 0 as well. Looks like it's gonna be tight to the end.</p>

    <p>Thursday: Lost 7-0 in dodgeball to the defending champions. I guess they are the champs for a reason. At least two of the games ended with me alone against all 6 of them. Both times, I got a few out but then got hit. On the plus side, I came up with a pretty interesting (though kinda cheesy) strategy. Gonna save it till the time is right.</p>

<p>After that, we lost to Butter's full team on Thursday. We had the game and were up a few in the third quarter. They scored 5 or 6 in a row, and then we lost by 3.</p>
