  <h1>Dodgeball and WL</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Thursday: Lost 7-0 in dodgeball to the defending champions. I guess they are the champs for a reason. At least two of the games ended with me alone against all 6 of them. Both times, I got a few out but then got hit. On the plus side, I came up with a pretty interesting (though kinda cheesy) strategy. Gonna save it till the time is right.</p>

<p>After that, we lost to Butter's full team on Thursday. We had the game and were up a few in the third quarter. They scored 5 or 6 in a row, and then we lost by 3.</p>

    <p>Beat Carol Jantsch on Sunday. Should have won by more. Partially my fault, I just can&#39;t resist the silly throws.</p>

  <h1>Spinners Tryouts</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Went to the Spinners tryout on Saturday. It was kinda like Southpaw practice, but not as ridiculous. Didn&#39;t start too well, but finished second in survivor deep cuts and fourth (with Glazer) in survivor Roman chair. During the scrimmage, I got a bunch of Ds but also threw it away a lot. Pretty much my MO.</p>

  <div>
    <p>Lost to Trey's full team on Tuesday. Got rocked: 28-15. And that was their second game of the day. I don&#39;t even know what to say or do to get us to play better. Lesson for future: don&#39;t captain. Just playing is way more fun. Alternatively, work on captaining before captaining again.</p>

  <h1>Wednesday and Thursday: Winter League</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Won our core game on Wednesday, then tied BLo's full team on Thursday.</p>

<p>Core: going pretty well. We're getting chillier on O and we ran a zone on D that worked well at first.</p>

<p>Full: our O is still having problems. We threw into a lot of poaches and made dumb mistakes. We're also still taking too long to sub.&nbsp;</p>

  <h1>Recap of Last Week</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Tuesday: Won a core league game against Ted's team</p>

<p>Thursday: Won a full league game against the Drexel team, then lost a game to TKO</p>

<p>Saturday: Lei-out. Beat Rocktapus Prime on universe, lost to a serious team, wrecked a weak team, lost our crossover to a fairly decent but not unbeatable team.</p>

<p>Sunday: Lei-out again. Won our first game, beat Massive Rooster on universe with three straight breaks (though I think we took half 7-4), beat Rocktapus Prime on universe again, lost in the finals (though we could have won if we played a tighter rotation).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lessons from Lei-out: hucking deep is extremely effective.</p>
