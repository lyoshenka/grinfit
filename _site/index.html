  <h1><a class="js-collapse">Spinners vs RI</a></h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden">
    <p>Last game of the regular season. We beat RI 29-20 or something like that. They only brought 12 guys, so they weren't taking this game seriously. We only played man on D because we didn't want to give away our defenses before the playoffs game. Overall, we played pretty well. We had trouble getting the disc off the sideline sometimes. Personally, I had a layout D and a blade for a goal in the same point, along with one or two caught goals. I played pretty well but got beat up the line and to the force-side cone a few times. Need to improve in those respects. I also had an up-line throw to Harrison that got Ded but he caught it anyway.</p>

<p>After the spinners game, Sean and I went to watch Termite's play their last game of the day at Philly Invite. They looked pretty sloppy, but that's to be expected of a new team with many of their top players not there. They went 0-4 on the day, but I saw some good plays from a few players, so I'm excited for the future.</p>

    <h2>Sprints</h2>

<ul>
<li>8x20m</li>
<li>6x40m</li>
<li>4x60m</li>
<li>2x80m</li>
</ul>


<h2>Suicides</h2>

<ul>
<li>5x 10m, 10m back, 20m</li>
<li>4x 10m, 10m back, 30m, walk back to the line, 30m back</li>
</ul>


<p>Each set of sprints and suicides was immediately followed by 1 minute of throwing and 2 minutes of rest</p>

<h2>Tape</h2>

<p>Watched the 3rd and 4th quarter of the Detroit game. Our D was fairly solid and we often got them stuck where we wanted them, but too often we let them out at the last second (typically on an in-cut or an up-line cut).</p>

<h2>Gym</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cleans: 2x155lb, 2x155lb, 3x135lb</li>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden">
    <p>From Indy, we went to Lexington, KY to play the Revolution. They were missing their best player and looked weak overall. We won 27-17. I played a good amount, especially at the end when we were up a lot. Again, no turns but no Ds (though we got several team Ds from our wolf). I scored two goals and cut fairly well most of the time.</p>

<p>After the game, we showered (well, hosed off) and hung out at the bar waiting for our bus. We played two games of Mafia (the first had 25 people) and I won both of them (as mafia the first time, and as a townsperson the second time). Boom!</p>

    <p>Traveled to Indianapolis to play the Alleycats. We won 19-16. I didn't play much but I was solid on D and had no turns. I think I caught one or two goals. Didn't get any Ds but my guy almost never touched the disc and my marks were strong.</p>

  <h1><a class="js-collapse">Spinners Track and Practice</a></h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden">
    <h2>Track</h2>

<ul>
<li>Warmup: jog the curves, accelerate to a sprint over the first 50m of the straightaway, decelerate back to a jog over the last 50m.</li>
<li>5x200m, 2 min rest between sprints.</li>
<li>5 min rest</li>
<li>2x Whistle drill (described below)</li>
<li>5 min rest</li>
<li>4x40m, 15 sec rest between sprints.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Whistle Drill</h3>

<p>Start jogging. When you hear the whistle, sprint. When you hear the next whistle, jog. Repeat. When you hear a long whistle, the person at the front of the pack starts jogging in place. Everyone else jogs to where they are and keeps jogging in place there. On the next whistle, everyone's back to sprinting.</p>

<p>The interval between whistles is between 3 and 12 seconds (random). Each rep was a full lap (400m). I think we did about 5 or 6 sprints total. The rule for jogging is that your arms cannot fall below your waist and your feet have to come up to your shins on each step (no baby-stepping).</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Start off with hunger drill, with each person taking turns throwing and the offense has to catch with both hands. Did backhands and flicks. Then moved on to scrimmage for 5 pulls. The D worked on zone-to-man for the first 5 pulls, then ran wolf for the next 5 (from a standstill). O and D took turns going through wolf. I honestly think the O did it better. They run a diamond in the backfield and do more switching than we do. After wolf, we played a 5 min game that went into overtime, then sudden death. The D got a turn and worked it up, but we turned it over on the goal line (I threw a dump over Panna's head). Then O scored.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden">
    <p>The whole team paid the piper at practice. Lots of pushups, planks, squats, 'sun gods' (hold your arms straight out, palms up), and jogging in lockstep. Then we worked on defending upline cuts on the dump (force them in, if they go behind you then turn towards the disc and use your arms to feel where they go) and baiting an IO to the front of the stack. We also worked on communicating on our cuts so we don't have timing issues. Then we watched film for an hour at Sussex.</p>

    <p>I finally got around to running the numbers on the AUDL games. I used <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=37">this algorithm</a>. The results are almost the same as the win-loss standings, but take a look at Indy vs Columbus (and also Bluegrass). They are very close in RRI (the <em>Final Score</em> column), but Columbus is ranked much lower in win-loss. In fact, Columbus has the same record as Rhode Island, which is ranked far below them in RRI.</p>

    <p>We lost a super close game to Detroit. They were up the whole time, but never by more than 3 or so. We came back to tie it up late in the 4th, but couldn't hold onto it.

    <p>Played in Buffalo against the Hunters. We jumped out to an early lead and won the game in every way. Their offense struggled (even with John Hassel) and their D only scored one or two breaks. We had 16 total turnovers the whole game, just missing our target of 14. Personally I think this was my best game so far (maybe tied with the first game in RI). 1 goal, 1 assist, 2 Ds, no turns. Also I was cutting very well, not rushing the cuts and waiting for the right time.</p>
