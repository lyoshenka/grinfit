  <h1>Dodgeball and WL</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Thursday: Lost 7-0 in dodgeball to the defending champions. I guess they are the champs for a reason. At least two of the games ended with me alone against all 6 of them. Both times, I got a few out but then got hit. On the plus side, I came up with a pretty interesting (though kinda cheesy) strategy. Gonna save it till the time is right.</p>

<p>After that, we lost to Butter's full team on Thursday. We had the game and were up a few in the third quarter. They scored 5 or 6 in a row, and then we lost by 3.</p>
