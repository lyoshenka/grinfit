  <div>
    <p>Thursday: WL</p>

<p>Lost to Butter&rsquo;s team in full for the third time this season. We played
really well, especially on D, but still lost. That puts us tied for 5th
with Drexel and TKO.</p>

<p>Friday: Gym</p>

<p>Deadlift 5,6,6 @ 205,225,255lb
Push Press 3x5 @ 95,115,115lb
Pull Ups 4,4,3 @ 45,40,35lb</p>

<p>Saturday: Ultisquash</p>

<p>Sunday: WL</p>

<p>Tied Brose&rsquo;s core team 20-20, then did 10 burpees, pistols, push ups and
full-body crunches. I played well in the first half, esp on D, but threw
away a LOT in the second half. Mostly deep throws to people covered by H or
bad up-line throws.</p>

  <h1>Spinners Tryout and Winter League</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Saturday: 3.5 hours of Spinners tryouts. It was windy and cold, but that didn&#39;t bother me too much after warmups. It&#39;s hard for me to tell how I did compared to anyone. I was top ten in the beep test, but otherwise we were broken up into groups and it looked like just about everyone played decent.</p>

<p>Sunday: Beat Trey&#39;s WL core team 20-19. Trey wasn&#39;t there, but the game was still close. We should have won by more because we were up 8-1 in the first quarter, but then really slowed down.</p>

  <h1>Disc Golf and Dodgeball</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Wednesday: Disc golf at Sedgely. I played really well on the front 18. I was -2 for a long time and finished -1. I've never even hit par before. The back back 9 went worse than usual, but we played the reds so that's to be expected. I think I was +3 for the back back (compared to -5 from the yellows the time before, but that was probably a major fluke).</p>

<p>Yesterday: Dodgeball playoffs. We're in the 5 through 8 bracket. I don't know what seed we are, but we won 7-3 last night so we're playing the 5v6 game next Thursday.</p>

  <h1>WL</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Tied Trey&#39;s team 19-19 today. I wanted to win, but I&#39;m very happy with how we played today. Faster subbing, better D, better (though at times still shaky) offense, more blades, more glory. Btw, my score in the &quot;Ds minus turns&quot; game with Diana is still 0. She&#39;s at 0 as well. Looks like it&#39;s gonna be tight to the end.</p>
