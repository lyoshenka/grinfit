  <h1>Spinners Practice and UDel Scrimmage</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Had Spinners practice 11-2pm, then went to UDel and scrimmaged their team (plus a few pickups) 4-7pm. My ankle didn&#39;t hurt after practice, despite playing a lot (played a bunch of O-line, which was interesting). I think I&#39;m almost fully healed.Also, met Bill Clemente at the first practice :-)</p>

  <h1>Wednesday: Spinners Gym Workout</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Did a gym workout with the team at our sponsor gym in Broomall. Not my typical workout, lots of repeated stuff (squats, leg press, upside down leg press) and isolation stuff (curls, tricep pulldown, calf raises), but it was kinda cool. I also did 101 sit ups in a row.</p>

  <h1>Spinners Practice Sat/Sun</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Had spinners practice both days. Ankle is still not fully healed, but I played most of both days. It seems to be fine when I&#39;m not playing, but gets worse as I play. I hope it heals completely by next weekend.</p>

  <h1>Kung Fu Throwing + Conditioning, Home Cindy-style Workout</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Yesterday: Spinners track workout at Temple. I still can&#39;t run, so Glazer and I did Parts 1 and 2 of Kung Fu Throwing. I liked part 1 but thought that part 2 was too short. That&#39;s the part that I need the most work on, but it has very few throws. I think I&#39;d double or triple that part next time. Then we did the typical Spinners conditioning (push ups, squats, abs).</p>

<p>Today: AMRAP in 20 min: 5 pull ups, 5 knees to elbows, 5 push ups. I got 13 rounds with about 3 seconds to spare.</p>

  <h1>Spinners Track Workout</h1>
  <div>
    <p>The team did a track workout at the Temple track yesterday. I was nursing a sprained ankle, so I didn&#39;t run. I threw around and did the conditioning part (push ups, squats, burpees, scissors, etc).</p>

  <h1>WL Finals and Spinners Tryout</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Played two games in winter league finals. First game was against Keg/Kuhfuss. We were up the whole game but I got hurt in the 3rd quarter (evertion ankle sprain) and we only won by one point. Next we played Laarz. I sat out the first half but started to play in the second half. We were down 5 late in the game, but then we threw the Trey zone and evened up the score. We couldn&#39;t pull ahead and ended up losing by 1.</p>

<p>After that, I went to Spinners tryouts. We did the beep test, breakmark drill, hunger drill and 40 meter survivor sprints. We also scrimmaged a lot. In the end, I made the team. Expect a lot of &quot;spinners practice&quot; posts.</p>
