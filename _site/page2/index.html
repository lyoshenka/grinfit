  <h1><a class="js-collapse">Southpaw Tryouts</a></h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden">
    <p>Went to Southpaw tryouts. We warmed up and ran through the baseball drill. Then we split into four teams and played a round-robin with games to 8. Wirst game, I played fairly well on d but threw a bunch of turns. Second and third game, no bad turns and a lot of caught goals. I did have one turn on a huck to Christian, but it was a good look and if I'd put a bit more distance on it, it would have been a goal. The real lesson, though, is that I usually cut too frantically. I did a lot better when I waited for my turn and set up real cuts than when I just ran around all the time. I think with all this time on defense, I'm forgetting how to play O.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden">
    <p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/frontal-cortex/2012/06/the-new-neuroscience-of-choking.html">Interesting article</a> on the science of choking. Here's how to avoid it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Practice a lot.</li>
<li>Once you're proficient, don't think about specific mechanics of the motion you're making. Instead, think about general adjectives or goals. For example, think "I want an outside-in huck to the middle of the endzone", not "I need to snap my wrist hard". Specifics are for practice, and the goal of practice is to encode the motion in muscle memory so you <em>don't</em> think about it during the game.</li>
<li>Don't forget to have fun. When you stop having fun, you start to think too much, and that's when you choke.</li>

    <p>Played mini with some of the spinners guys. We played two sets of first-to-seven-wins. We started off with me, Billy and Jaffe vs Patrick, Brando and Dbaer. My team won the first set 7-3. We were down 3-2 or so in the second set when Glazer showed up and we started to sub. They went up 5-2 or so, but after some subbing, they all rotated to the other team and my team ended up winning 7-4. I learned that I have pretty good throws in mini.</p>

<p>Squat theory: Jaffe said my squats may be messed up because my hamstrings are weak relative to the rest of my muscles. Sounds reasonable.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden">
    <p>Played the Columbus Cranes. The word on the street was that they are athletic and looking to huck it on O and lay out on D. That's exactly what they did. We started off strong (because we didn't give the O line a chance to get broken first point :-p) but went down a break or two at the end of the first and stayed there till halfway into the fourth. We ended up winning by 3 but I think it was our worst game yet.</p>

    <p>We won 24-18, but I think the game was all-around crappy. We didn't play well and didn't really deserve to win, but they sucked more. I found out later that they were missing their top 4 or 5 cutters, so it makes sense that their O was sluggish.</p>

<p>I had two turnovers (one to Leon in the end one that popped up from the wind, one on a fast break with 5 seconds left in the quarter when I rushed a throw). I also threw one assist. Very mediocre in general. I was close on everything but no Ds.</p>
