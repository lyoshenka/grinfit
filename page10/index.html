    <p>What an epic nationals! We came in seeded 8th overall, the 2nd seed in the pool of death. We had the overall 1 seed (Amp), a
severely-underseeded Blackbird, and Ambiguously Grey - a team that finished 6th last year after starting out in the bottom half. Rockford,
IL was very windy on Thurs and Fri, so the games were very upwind-downwind.</p>

<p>Our first game against Blackbird was super-close the whole way. Our D got many chances to score upwind, but we couldn&rsquo;t convert any of them.
Blackbird broke us twice in the first half, and was sitting pretty with the lead. In the second half, we started playing some of our
stronger throwers on D, and finally got the upwind break, then the downwind break. The cap went on, and we were pulling upwind on universe
point. Miraculously, we got the D and worked it all the way upwind to score the break and pull out the win 12-11.</p>

<p>After this amazing win, we kept rolling. We crushed AG 11-6 in a very windy second game, then faced off against Amp to earn the bye into
quarters. This is the game I had been looking forward to. Amp was the 1 seed, but we had beaten them before and knew they were not
invincible. We started out really strong, scoring the first 3 points. Then we quickly gave up a few breaks to let Amp close, before breaking
to take half 8-6. In the second half, we broke twice more, taking the win 12-9. They showed our game on Ultiworld, which was really cool for
my family. Even the Germans got to watch me play.</p>

<p>Winning out on Thurs earned us a bye into quarters, and the right to play only one game a day until we lost. It also put Amp on the other
side of the bracket, together with Drag'n Thrust, Slow White, and Mixtape (who lost to Mischief). This means we had the easiest road to
finals of any of the other teams. In quarters, we stomped Noise 15-7, sending us to semis (my first time playing in semis). There, we faced
a tough Mischief team. The wind died down, but we still made a lot of mistakes (dropping the very first pull, throwing several miscued
dumps, etc). We also had several great plays (including a Callahan from John G). The game was very close throughout. We started down,
clawed back to take half 8-7, went down 8-9, then scored 3 breaks in a row to basically seal the deal. We ended up winning 14-11, and making
the big game - finals against Slow White.</p>

<p>Slow is definitely the team I wanted to play against in the finals. They were very good all around, but we had proven we could beat them if
we played well. I also have a lot of friends on that team, so playing against them is always fun. We started off the way we always do - by
giving up a few breaks. Slow broke us 3 times in a row. We regrouped and a few points later, broke them 3 times back. They broke again at
6-5, we broke at 7-6 to take half 8-6. Being a second-half team, we were knew we had them right where we wanted them. However, tight subbing
really drained our stars, and we started making mistakes. They broke us at 8-7, then again at 9s to take the lead. Finally, up 12-11, they
broke us 3 times to win it 15-11. In retrospect, we definitely had the ability to win that game and I wish we had played it a bit
differently. On the other hand, what&rsquo;s done is done, and I&rsquo;m still very happy with the outcome. I played well all weekend, improving
throughout. I played my best game in the finals, throwing two assists (one a half-field breakside huck). If someone had told me on Thursday
that we were gonna take 2nd place, I would have been psyched. Losing in the finals stings, but that was the only sad part of an otherwise
incredible nationals.</p>

<p>Final stat line: 0 goals, 3 assists (2 in the finals), 1 D, 1 turnover (against Blackbird).</p>

    <p>An exciting weekend for Metro North. We won the region, beating Slow White (the top seed, and #2 in the country) 15-13 in the finals. That
game was one of the cleanest and most focused games I&rsquo;ve ever played. Our O line only had two turns, and only let Slow convert one of them.
Our D line converted two breaks (I caught both of them :-) ), and had a chance to convert at least one more. I felt like I was completely
in the zone and focused on the game. I did talk to people on the sideline, but I barely remember what I said.</p>

<p>Before the finals, we had a few close games with 7X and Wildcard. I played fairly well in those too, though I had one or two turns on Sat
and missed some D opportunities.</p>

<p>As far as ultimate goes, I did not play that well. A <strong>lot</strong> of turns - rushed throws, bad decisions, just not there mentally. I need to
focus on taking an extra second before every throw, even the easy ones. It may feel slow, but I think it will up my percentage. And NO HUCKS
unless its obviously the right throw.</p>

<p>Off the field, I killed it at slap cup.</p>

    <p>I stayed with Miriam on Sunday night after Pro Flight, and she invited me to play goalty with her team. At first I thought I&rsquo;d be too tired
and sore to play, but I decided to come out and see how it went. I ended up playing the whole time and had a blast. The people were fun and
we had the right number of subs - enough to feel fresh but not too many to stand around a lot. I&rsquo;m still learning goalty, so I made a bunch
of mistakes, but I did mack a disc for a goal and throw a Rochester for a goal that was dropped. Overall I noticed that people have a
tendency to all hang out in and around the goal, which makes scoring extra hard. I think more discipline to stay away from the arch would
create more space and make scoring easier.</p>

    <p>6 games across 2 days. We didn&rsquo;t have many players, and lost some to injury as the weekend went on, so I got a lot of reps. I tried out KT
tape for my knee, and am happy to report that it did not bother me at all on Saturday and only hurt a little on Sunday (whether this
correlation implies any causation or not, I still don&rsquo;t know). I had more turns and less Ds this weekend than I did in Colorado, but I also
had to handle more since Lucas wasn&rsquo;t there and Liz is out for the season. I esp played poorly against Amp and Drag'n Thrust, with several
turns in each game that were caused by rushing a throw - my main problem area. If we converted just a few more breaks, we could have won
those games (or at least kept them competitive).</p>

<p>I threw the longest huck for a goal of my life - an 80-yard endzone-to-endzone huck to Mari. To be fair my mark was slow to get set so I had
a wide-open backhand, but it&rsquo;s still a nice achievement.</p>

<p>The rope climbs were tough but pretty fun. I burned my shin pretty hard on the first round. After that I found a wrist wrap and wrapped that

more if I tried harder to go slow in the first round. Then again, I was pretty beat from the first part of the workout, and I&rsquo;m pretty weak

    <p>Went on a 3-day, 2-night hike in the mountains by Mestia, Georgia. The plan was to hike up to the Guli pass (Гульба), look over the edge,
then come down. But we started our hikes fairly late both days, so we missed the summit by about an hour or two (had to turn back in order
to make it down in time). I&rsquo;d never been on an all-out hike like this. We carried all our food and gear with us. We camped on the glacier
both nights (first night on the rocks embedded in the ice, second night on the snow/ice itself). We used helmets, crampons, harnesses, and
ice picks. It was pretty intense, but a lot of fun. The views were magnificent and the camaraderie was really gratifying. Plus it was great
to see my dad and his friends relive the good old days of &ldquo;extreme hiking&rdquo;, and to meet the next generation of explorers.</p>

<p>By the time we came down on day 3, I was thoroughly exhausted. I hadn&rsquo;t slept well for 3 nights (due to the cold, the snoring tentmates, and
the late-night partying). The descent was pretty challenging, and since I got down first, I went back twice to help the rest of the crew
with their packs. On the upside, my knee hurt a lot less than I expected. Maybe I need to reevaluate what triggers my tendonitis.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days of ultimate at 6000ft. Actually, the altitude didn&rsquo;t bother me nearly as much as I thought it would. I felt fine the whole time. We
did bring a full roster, which helped keep everyone fresh and well-rested.</p>

<p>On the whole, a solid weekend for the team. We lost in the finals and played some games closer than we should have (e.g. Platypi,
Blackbird). But we also had a lot of good moments and some strong comebacks. Our D was especially solid, digging us out of holes a few
times.</p>

<p>Personally, I ended the weekend with a +3 on my score-o-meter (Ds minus turns). My only turn was my first throw of the tourney - a dump to
Lucas that I threw a bit too hard and too wide for him to get to. I think this might be my highest score in a few years. I must be getting
old. I even called a timeout once.</p>

<p>Off the field, this was one of the best tourneys we&rsquo;ve had. Hanging out with Squeege and others in CO was great. The highlight was our
2-hour-long game of Crazy Grapes in Squeege&rsquo;s pool. I also went motown dancing, explored downtown Denver, celebrated Kerry&rsquo;s birthday,
played Dominion, and watched lots of people catch lots of Pokemon.</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>4x3+2 Push Press + Jerk, building</li>
<li>4x12 Barbell Russian Twist, building</li>
</ul>


<p>Got up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">125</span>lb </span> for the presses, <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>lb </span> for the twists. I&rsquo;d never done twists with the bar before, and didn&rsquo;t really have time
to do many.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time (8min Cap):</p>

<ul>
<li>100 total Russian Twist with a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>lb </span> plate</li>
<li>50 Push Press @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">65</span>lb </span></li>
<li><del>400m Sprint</del> 20cal on the Air Bike</li>
</ul>


<p>I finished in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span>:<span class="number">40</span> </span>. The push presses killed me, even though I scaled down from 75lb. I did the twists really fast (nonstop) and
crushed the air bike in 40 seconds, but struggled on the presses. At the end I was doing 2 or 3 at a time, dropping the bar to my waist,
then cleaning it back up and doing a few more. It was rough.</p>

<h2>Summer League</h2>

<p>After the WOD, I went straight to summer league. I&rsquo;m glad I did that, because we didn&rsquo;t get to play much - games got rained out right before
halftime. It really sucked, because our team was only playing with 6 players at a time (we only had 2 women) and we were up 5-3 when the
games got called. If only we&rsquo;d played a few points, we could have earned a win playing 6 v 7. On the plus side, I got to go home early :-)</p>

<p>15 minutes of Push Press. Work up to a heavy triple.</p>

<p>I maxed out at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">3</span>@<span class="number">145</span>lb </span>. I got 2@155lb on the following set but missed the 3rd rep :-(</p>

<h2>Skill</h2>

<p>6min EMOM: 6 Box Jumps at a challenging height.</p>

<p>I started at 30in but bumped up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">33</span>in </span> after the second set. I was finishing all 6 in about 20 seconds each time.</p>

<h2>WOD 1</h2>

<p>3min AMRAP:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Push Press @ 55% of max weight from part 1</li>
<li>1 Box Jump @ 30in</li>
<li>2 Push Presses</li>
<li>2 Box Jumps</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>


<p>I got through exactly <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">7</span> rounds </span> in 3min.</p>

<p>After a 3min rest, we did&hellip;</p>

<h2>WOD 2</h2>

<p>Same as WOD 1, but in reverse. Start where you finished the first WOD (that&rsquo;s 7 reps of each for me) and work your way down. The goal is to
finish everything from WOD 1 in 3 minutes.</p>

<p>I managed to do this WOD even faster than the first one. Finished in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">2</span>:<span class="number">50</span> </span>, 10 seconds to spare.</p>

<p>This was a fun workout.</p>

    <p>Pretty easy summer league game. It was quite windy and they had a lot of trouble with our zone. I spent most of thet time covering and being
covered by Brendan, a captain of Colt. He did a good job making me work hard to get open, which is exactly the kind of thing that&rsquo;s usually
missing in summer league. Glad I came to this game.</p>

<p>15 min of Overhead Squat, working up to a heavy triple. I got up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">85</span>lb </span> and probably could have kept going but ran out of time.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>This was supposed to be a Jump Rope tabata, but I can&rsquo;t jump so I subbed in a bunch of stuff:</p>

<p>Two rounds through of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Max Cals on Air Bike</li>
<li>Slamballs</li>
<li>Goblet Squats with Slamball</li>
<li>Russian Twists with Slamball</li>
</ul>


<p>I used a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span> slamball. I didn&rsquo;t count the reps, but I got through about 12 slams, 12-13 squats, and 24-26 twists.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>AMRAP. 4 rounds of:</p>

<p>With 2:00 on the clock:</p>

<ul>
<li>40m OH Walking Lunge Steps</li>
<li>Remaining time: max cals on the air bike</li>
</ul>


<p>Rest 1:00 between rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Right at the end of the 4th round (at min. 11), complete 30 seconds of max slam balls. Each slam ball counts as 5 cals.</p>

<p>I got <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">24</span> cals </span> on the air bike and <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">13</span> slam balls </span>.</p>
