    <p>Tryouts went 3-6pm Saturday and then 9am-noon on Sunday. The format was mostly this: warm up, a bit of cutting/throwing drills, 3v3 mini,
4v4 full-field, 7v7 full-field. I had a lot of fun both days, playing against good players and being outside. The weather was a bit cold and
rainy today, but it really was not a problem.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel a bit more tired that I should (and felt somewhat more tired throughout the weekend then I think I should). I&rsquo;m chalking
it up to early-seasonness, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve felt this way in previous seasons (even last season, when I took 5 weeks off in
April-May). However, my flick hucks were pretty good for most of the weekend (only had one mistake), my breaks were solid, and my D was good
for the most part. I had a lot of trouble with Korber and Match, but did a good job on just about everyone else. My main problem was my
backhand hucks (I&rsquo;m 0-for-2) and timidness in the air (got skied a few times when I shouldn&rsquo;t have). My I/O flick was also a bit shitty at
times during mini, but that&rsquo;s probably due to fatigue for the most part.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

<p>5-cone zig zag + 25m sprint back to the start. You have to do a full 360 around each cone.</p>

<p>The 360 part was the hardest part, esp because you&rsquo;d never do that in a real game (except Dizzy Bat). My best time was <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">15</span>:<span class="number">34</span> </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>12:00 AMRAP:</p>

<ul>
<li>8 Wall Balls (20lb)</li>
<li>12 KB swings (53lb)</li>
<li>16 AbMat situps</li>
</ul>


<p>Anytime a movement is not done unbroken, it is a 2 Burpee penalty.</p>

<p>The goal of this WOD is to eliminate &ldquo;sudden rests&rdquo; - the feeling that you have to stop right now and you can&rsquo;t do any more reps. The idea
is that you should be planning your rest in every WOD, and keeping a bit in the tank for that last-minute kick. We were allowed to rest
between exercises, but suddenly stopping an exercise would be a penaly. It actually seemed to work out pretty well. I got through <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span> rounds + <span class="number">8</span> reps </span>
of the WOD. I felt tired at the end, but not super dead. I did go a bit harder at the very end, but didn&rsquo;t have all that much &ldquo;kick&rdquo; left.</p>

<p>Finished up with a bit of butterfly pullup practice. I used to be better at those.</p>

<p>I built up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">155</span>lb </span> for the triple.</p>

<p>Form feedback: when I set up, keep my butt higher and my shoulders in front of the bar (lats over the bar). This will fix my problem of the
bar hitting my knees on the way up, and me having to pull back instead of up. I should also go a bit slower on the deadlift portion of the
clean.</p>

<li>15 KBS at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">70</span>lb </span></li>

    <p>Played 2 hours of mini at the Yale IM fields. I felt very out of shape, most likely because I spent all winter lifting heavy and not running
at all. Chasing Ross and Bosco around for 2 hours killed me. Really looking forward to switching to Crossfit/shuttles for the next few
months.</p>

    <p>Two days of semi-serious ultimate in tiger costumes. Calvinball was a prety stacked team, but we managed to play quite poorly. We lost some
games we shouldn&rsquo;t have (including one on universe after being up 8-2 at half), we failed to take advantage of our 2-pointer rule, and we
were overall not very focused. But that&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s fools fest. Personally I tried not to play much, and I was mostly happy with how that
went. I got a layout D on a hammer, caught a two-pointer, caught a Callahan on a scoober dump, and only had a few turnovers. It was quite
windy, especially on Sunday, but even my &ldquo;start-on-O-upwind&rdquo; strategy failed to backfire :-).</p>

    <p>~40 min of 2-on-2 mini with Ross, Barb and Diana. We played in the smallest
field I&rsquo;ve ever played on. Plus the wind made it even tougher. But it was
fun and a good warmup for Fools.</p>

    <p>Half an hour of throwing with Adubs. Worked on my flicks. I&rsquo;m releasing my flick too far in front of my body, which makes it hard to keep it
I/O and hard to put power on it.</p>

<p>After throwing, 90 minutes of BAD. Today&rsquo;s focus was lateral movement - resisted shuffles and shuffle suicides were the main event. Then we
did our standard medball core workout and cardio circuit. At the end, I talked everyone into doing sled push relays, which ended up being
tougher than I expected (but still fun).</p>

<p>Before the workout, I measured my vert. Standing vert was <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>&ldquo; </span>, and I got <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">30</span>&rdquo; </span> with the approach. This is almost exactly the
same numbers I got in Boston in 2010 (26" standing, 30" approach). I didn&rsquo;t warm up though, so I think I can do better. Kevin told me that I
don&rsquo;t swing my arms aggressively enough, and that I need to swing them straight up.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today was the same as yesterday, but with C&amp;J instead of snatch. I got there early, but the place was still packed by the time I got into
the heavy sets. I guessed high for my 1rm target (didn&rsquo;t want to start really low like yesterday) and ended up being pretty dead-on. I
started at ~55kg and jumped up pretty quickly to about 75kg. From there, I went in small steps up to 85kg. My cleans were decent near the
end, but my jerks were pretty bad. My 85kg jerk was maybe the ugliest one I&rsquo;ve ever done. Still, it would have counted in competition, so
I&rsquo;m counting it. I tried 85 a second time and failed the jerk.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The plan was to start 20kg below my target 1RM, do 5 reps at that weight, 5 reps at +5kg, 5 at +10kg, then singles the rest of the way,
going up 1-3kg at a time. But I didn&rsquo;t really have a target, so I started way too low and spent a long time working my way up. I went pretty
strong up to 58kg, then missed 3 times at 60kg right before they closed. It only started to feel heavy towards the end, so I think I could
have hit it with a bit more time and practice. The feedback I got was to focus more on my form. I was just jerking the bar up when it got
heavy, instead of focusing on good form and using my legs to drive hard. I think my best single lift was around 55kg. It really felt solid
because I dropped under the bar and it didn&rsquo;t really move after. It just stopped in place, and then I squatted it up.</p>
