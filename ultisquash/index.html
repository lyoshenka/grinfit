    <p>Large group at ultisquash today - 11 guys, 4 ladies. Would have been great for two games, but there was a track meet and all the courts were taken. We had
to talk one of the trainers into switching to another court so we can have the good one. So we assigned a number to each guy and rotated everyone (every
third game was an all-guys game). As people started leaving, we consolidated and went back to standard ultisquash subbing free-for-all. We also played
games to 5 at first, then went back to 7 and finished with a hard-to-9 final that came down to the wire.</p>

Owen&rsquo;s first time playing, and he played really well. Everyone was a bit

great to get out and run around some.</p>

    <p>Sara got a few AMPers to come to Haverford and help coach the Sneetches. We worked on upline dump defense and then pulling. I brought Diana&rsquo;s iPad and the
Ubersense app, which was really helpful in showing the girls where they were missing out on extra torque on their pulls.</p>

<blockquote><p>We play better when we eat our Cheddar.<br>
We never miss when we eat our Swiss.<br>
We get the D when we eat our Brie.<br>
We win the party when we eat Havarti.</p></blockquote>

<p>After practice, we went over to the squash courts and played over an hour of ultisquash. It was good to get back into the game. We had a wide range of
talent, from people who&rsquo;ve played a lot to people who&rsquo;ve only played once or twice. The games were pretty fun, but with lots of turns. I need to figure out
how to minimize my turns and throw more effectively.</p>

    <h2>Ultisquash</h2>

<p>The veteran&rsquo;s ultisquash fight club committee decided to honor Diana and me by inviting us to their elite game. In attendance: Wheels, Schmucker, TC, Panna, Dre, Raha, us. We played a dozen or so games, all intense and fast-paced. I really enjoyed playing with Schmucker and Wheels. They don&rsquo;t come out much and I don&rsquo;t get to play with them that often. Also covering TC was a lot of fun. What a great way to end the season.</p>

<h2>Spinners Practice</h2>

<p>I was rather sore after all that ultisquashing, but decided to go to Spinners practice anyway. The weather was finally nice and it&rsquo;s good to get my outdoor throws straight as early as possible. We spent a good amount of time on drills and working on some set plays, then scrimmaged a lot. We started our first set of scrimmages with a hunger-drill throw to simulate playing after a huck. I&rsquo;ve never done that before but I really like it. We also played a bunch of 2-minute make-it-take-it games and worked on double-teaming.</p>

<p>I was really tired by the time we started scrimmaging, and it didn&rsquo;t help that we had very few subs. I thought I played reasonably well and had some good throws and cuts, though I dropped the disc TWICE during the 4 lines cutting drill (where we were specifically trying not to drop the disc by focusing on catching one point of it) and also turfed an easy throw to DBaer because I didn&rsquo;t pivot.</p>

<p>2 solid hours of ultisquash. Had enough for 2 games but no one wanted to play on the slippery court so we mostly alternated. Finished up with 2 all-guy games. Might be my last ultisquash till the fall.</p>

    <p>Another 2 hours of ultisquash. Played with some of the greats in the game: Schmucker, TC, Wheels, Raha, Diana. We had some really heated and competitive games. I spent a bunch of time covering Schmucker and even got some Ds on him, so I think my game is improving. My throws still need work though. I need to do a search for how often I&rsquo;ve used that phrase (or some variation of it) on this blog.</p>

<p>I ended the session pretty banged up: slightly rolled ankle, almost hyperextended my elbow, sore fingers and knees, etc. It&rsquo;s gonna be nice to take the next week of in Hawaii.</p>

    <p>2 hours of ultisquash. We split time between the good court and the dark, slippery court. I don&rsquo;t think I lost any games when Diana or Ross were on my team. Diana, Cline and I even managed to win a game 7-0.</p>

    <p>2 hours of ultisquash. Had enough for two games but the courts are falling farther and farther into disrepair so it was tough to play. We ended up using a court that was quite slippery and had no door. It made for some interesting games.</p>

<p>Played a bunch of ultisquash in the morning. We hav enough people for two games, so we played pretty much nonstop. I was undefeated until the very last game.</p>

<h2>Amp Indoor</h2>

<p>Another great indoor session. We spent more time working on downfield cutting. One thing we did was eliminate the dump in several drills. We also worked on cutter timing and some short 3 on 3 drills. We finished with a bunch of scrimmages, throwing, rolling and dinner at Butter&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>My indoor throws have definitely been improving. Fitness is still a bit lacking, though that may be because of the ultisquash.</p>

<p>On the way home, we saw the train leave the platform right as we got there. Adam did some baller driving to get me to the next station right as the train got there. So fast, so furious.</p>
