    <p>Another year, another nationals. This year it was back in Sarasota. The weather was hot, but the location is the best - the fields were
beautiful, the ocean was amazing (even at night, and even despite the jellyfish), and the Daquiri Deck was even better than I remember it.
The only thing lacking was our game. We lost all our games on Thursday (9-12 Blackbird, 11-12 AMP, 11-12 Toro), then won the next 4 games
and clawed our way back into the top 8 before losing the 7/8 game to Drag'n Thrust (13-10 Love Tractor, 14-11 Steamboat, 12-11 Blackbird,
15-9 shame, 9-15 Drag'n). So, no finals appearance this year, but we did win the spirit award, which is almost as big.</p>

<p>Personally I played fairly well. I was only in 2-4 points a game, so I was fresh overall. I had 3 turns total - a drop against AMP and two
throwaways on hucks. Both were good decisions, decently well-thrown, and just a little off the mark. We talked about taking calculated
risks, so I stand by them. I scored 5 goals, threw one, and got a D. I felt I could have contributed more, esp filling in as an O line
cutter when our O was tired (like the last game on Thurs), but we ran a fairly tight rotation so I did my best to help from the sideline.</p>

<p>Another nationals highlight was watching AMP make it to the finals for the first time ever. They played really well, but ended up losing on
universe to Mixtape in a very exciting game. Despite that, I&rsquo;m really happy for them. Their team is very young and they&rsquo;ll be strong for a
few years at least (if they stick together).</p>

<p>Finally, the best part (as always) is spending time with people you know and like. I had a great time bonding with the team (chai time,
skinny dipping every night, getting kicked off the beach at 4am, dirty dancing at the Daquiri Deck, spikeball vs Truck/Scandal) as well as
people I don&rsquo;t get to see that often (again at the Deck, and at the fields, and the beach, and random places in between).</p>

<p>Hope to do it all again next year.</p>

    <p>We came, we saw, we conquered (except for Slow). We started the weekend off in classic Metro North fashion: by ignoring everything we
practice and jamming it in the jamhole repeatedly. But we eventually got our shit together, moved the disc well, and raised our game. The
crossover with Slow was an epic back-and-forth game, and we even got the D on the goal line on universe and had the opportunity to win it,
but a nice D by Todd got them the disc back and they converted for the win. On Sunday, we had a really close game with Xist - another
universe-point game, but this time we won it and qualified for Nationals. We played Slow again in the finals, but it was just for seeding
and half our team sat the game out.</p>

<p>Peronally, my main errors were on hucks. When I&rsquo;m rushing my huck or I feel like I have to throw it (when we call Sausage), it never goes
well. When I&rsquo;m throwing in a power position or it feels natural, I&rsquo;m great. Besides that, my game was great - solid defense (including
several points where not only did my guy never touch the disc, but I felt like he was never open at all), strong cutting, and consistently
moving the disc to the breakside. My only turns were 3 hucks, and only one of them was a bad decision. I even felt strong and fast all
weekend, never feeling like I cannot keep up with my defender or cannot keep cutting well.</p>

    <p>A weekend in Boston with Metro North 2017. I&rsquo;m in the worst shape ever going into a season, with several nagging injuries. Despite that, I
still played pretty well. My two turns were both poor-decision, poor-execution hucks. I also had some mistakes on D, getting beat badly a
few times. On the upside, I had 3 Ds including a fall-over handblock on the mark, I threw some nice throws and hucks, and my legs felt ok at
the end of Sunday. Even running the nine 40s at the end (one for each OB pull all weekend) felt pretty good.</p>

    <p>An exciting weekend for Metro North. We won the region, beating Slow White (the top seed, and #2 in the country) 15-13 in the finals. That
game was one of the cleanest and most focused games I&rsquo;ve ever played. Our O line only had two turns, and only let Slow convert one of them.
Our D line converted two breaks (I caught both of them :-) ), and had a chance to convert at least one more. I felt like I was completely
in the zone and focused on the game. I did talk to people on the sideline, but I barely remember what I said.</p>

<p>Before the finals, we had a few close games with 7X and Wildcard. I played fairly well in those too, though I had one or two turns on Sat
and missed some D opportunities.</p>

    <p>6 games across 2 days. We didn&rsquo;t have many players, and lost some to injury as the weekend went on, so I got a lot of reps. I tried out KT
tape for my knee, and am happy to report that it did not bother me at all on Saturday and only hurt a little on Sunday (whether this
correlation implies any causation or not, I still don&rsquo;t know). I had more turns and less Ds this weekend than I did in Colorado, but I also
had to handle more since Lucas wasn&rsquo;t there and Liz is out for the season. I esp played poorly against Amp and Drag'n Thrust, with several
turns in each game that were caused by rushing a throw - my main problem area. If we converted just a few more breaks, we could have won
those games (or at least kept them competitive).</p>

<p>I threw the longest huck for a goal of my life - an 80-yard endzone-to-endzone huck to Mari. To be fair my mark was slow to get set so I had
a wide-open backhand, but it&rsquo;s still a nice achievement.</p>

    <p>Two days of ultimate at 6000ft. Actually, the altitude didn&rsquo;t bother me nearly as much as I thought it would. I felt fine the whole time. We
did bring a full roster, which helped keep everyone fresh and well-rested.</p>

<p>On the whole, a solid weekend for the team. We lost in the finals and played some games closer than we should have (e.g. Platypi,
Blackbird). But we also had a lot of good moments and some strong comebacks. Our D was especially solid, digging us out of holes a few
times.</p>

<p>Personally, I ended the weekend with a +3 on my score-o-meter (Ds minus turns). My only turn was my first throw of the tourney - a dump to
Lucas that I threw a bit too hard and too wide for him to get to. I think this might be my highest score in a few years. I must be getting
old. I even called a timeout once.</p>

<p>Off the field, this was one of the best tourneys we&rsquo;ve had. Hanging out with Squeege and others in CO was great. The highlight was our
2-hour-long game of Crazy Grapes in Squeege&rsquo;s pool. I also went motown dancing, explored downtown Denver, celebrated Kerry&rsquo;s birthday,
played Dominion, and watched lots of people catch lots of Pokemon.</p>

    <p>Another glorious OMK is in the books. Highlights from the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Darts and credit card roulette for spin-the-wheel on Friday = 4 hours of sleep</li>
<li>First point of Saturday - we have 4 players there on time</li>
<li>Pool(tub) of shame</li>
<li>Gooch wears a $90 shark wrestling singlet</li>
<li>Games got rained out around noon on Sat</li>
<li>Circling the wagons, playing dice and drinking, car-swapping relay races</li>
<li>Front seat must be naked</li>
<li>Day drinking and pizza box at Mike&rsquo;s</li>
<li>No one is allowed to take off clothes when they shower</li>
<li>Dinner with Seth &amp; Jennie</li>
<li>Anti-thumper at Wolff&rsquo;s</li>
<li>After-party at Liz&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house</li>
<li>First game on sunday - opponents warm up for half an hour, we win 13-4</li>
<li>Tom Kirby&rsquo;s 15-year-old son Jack picks up with us for the day. He&rsquo;s pretty good for being 15.</li>
<li>Second game - we fall behind pretty hard, rally the troups, eke out a win</li>
<li>I throw Dana a terrible floaty huck, do my penance by drinking a sip from the pool of shame</li>
<li>Squirt-gun shootout with a 4-year-old</li>
<li>Semis - game is very upwind/downwind, we can&rsquo;t catch a disc in the endzone to save our lives, lose 13-9</li>
<li>Last point of semis: I catch a nice half-field throw from Brown, dish it, drop the next pass. Handler picks up, I handblock his hammer,
cut to the endzone. Brown throws to my S-cut, it gets Ded, I lay out a million feet to catch it. Rush to stand up and throw the goal, get
footblocked. About 30 seconds of my highest highs and lowest lows for the day.</li>
<li>I threw and caught at least 1 Rochester each</li>
<li>Post-tourney burgers at Jumping Jacks, grilling at Liz&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s, home by 8pm</li>

    <p>6 games over 3 days at the US Open. We did really well, winning our pool (despite a last-game loss to Polar Bears) and then losing a close
game to Slow in the semis. Personally, I wasn&rsquo;t at the top of my game because my toe was killing me, but it actually got better throughout
the weekend and I played my best game against Slow. I even got a shoutout after games on Saturday for continuing to cut hard even late in
the day/tournament.</p>

<p>Besides the ultimate, I had a lot of fun hanging out with the team. We drank beer, went swimming in the ocean, played games, watched
ultimate, and enjoyed each others company. It was a great start to the season.</p>

    <p>Two long, hot days of ultimate with not many subs. The D line guys were practically savage all weekend, especially Saturday. DJ left halfway
into the second game, so the four of us (Lucas, Billy YoungJo, and I) played every D point after that. Occaisionally one or two others would
sub in and help out, but that was basically it. On top of that, I did a bad job taking care of myself (not enough water, salt and sunblock, not
enough sleep and food the day before). In one of the very last points of the fourth game, I cramped up super-hard (both hamstrings and a
calf) and had to lie on the ground for 10 min before I could get up again. Thankfully the game ended and we were done for the day.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I took extra care to eat and drink a lot (I also ice-showered the night before), and felt way better. We were still low on
numbers, but DJ returned and John G&rsquo;s hamstring felt better so he played a few points. Despite playing the whole previous day, I felt less
tired after Sunday than I did after Saturday. The caffeine and electrolyte pills probably helped too.</p>

<p>Game-wise, I guess I played well. I&rsquo;m not happy about my lack of forced Ds and how tired I felt, but its hard to compare that to a normal
game where I&rsquo;ll have proper subs. I didn&rsquo;t throw many turnovers, which is great for me, but I did make several fatigue-induced mistakes (not
helping out on a few discs, getting beat upline, dropping two discs that I had my hands on, some throwaways). Then again, I played solid
defense the vast majority of the time. Even in the last game, I stuck close to my guy a lot and ran a few nice switches with Billy. I guess
my main problem was summoning the will to cut hard after a turn, esp late in the day. On the points where I forced myself to go hard, we
usually did well and scored quickly. On the points where I was too tired, it was hard to make things happen. I gained a lot of respect for
the other guys on the line (esp Billy) and their nonstop effort after turns.</p>

<p>I picked up a few minor injuries (a bruise under my big toe nail, some soreness in my tendons), but my tendonitis doesnt seem to be
bothering me today. I hope it still feels good after US Open next week, and continues to hold throughout the season.</p>

    <p>7 games across 2 days at Windmill. Played the Portuguese and Polish
nationals teams, club teams from all over Europe, a team from Israel, and
one US-ish pickup team. We were very solid for a pickup team, but were
inconsistent and plagued with injuries. Finished 17th with a 4-4 record - a
lot of close losses and hard-fought games.</p>

<p>Personal highlights include a big layout D, several nice hucks, solid
handling and cutting all around, and some good lessons learned about
leadership (mostly: if the team expects you to lead, you have to lead. Even
if you like to keep it loose, you are in charge and need to provide
direction)</p>

<p>The best part of windmill is, or course, the people. Our whole team was
talented, extremely friendly and nice. The Portuguese team was awesome (my
fav game, I think) and I saw a bunch of BDP friends. I also made some new
friends that I hope to see again sometime. Maybe windmill &lsquo;17?</p>

    <p>Two days of semi-serious ultimate in tiger costumes. Calvinball was a prety stacked team, but we managed to play quite poorly. We lost some
games we shouldn&rsquo;t have (including one on universe after being up 8-2 at half), we failed to take advantage of our 2-pointer rule, and we
were overall not very focused. But that&rsquo;s ok, it&rsquo;s fools fest. Personally I tried not to play much, and I was mostly happy with how that
went. I got a layout D on a hammer, caught a two-pointer, caught a Callahan on a scoober dump, and only had a few turnovers. It was quite
windy, especially on Sunday, but even my &ldquo;start-on-O-upwind&rdquo; strategy failed to backfire :-).</p>

    <a class="js-collapse" itemprop="name">Boston Goalty Tourney</a>
  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played a really fun goaltimate tournament in Boston. The tourney was really high-level - all elite club players who play a lot of goalty. I
started out playing pretty poorly but learned a lot and got significantly better throughout the day. Our team lost all our games, but then
we played a few hours of pickup, which was even better than the games.</p>

<p>The main things I learned are that the easiest way to score is to get the disc in front of the goal, in the middle. Then have one person
stand behind the scoring circle (a few feet back). This forces their defender to choose to look at them or the thrower. It also makes sure
they can&rsquo;t hang out in the middle, and have to either play tight on you (which lets you cut in for the goal) or play loose, which lets the
thrower throw it over them to you. You can also score by making a horizontal cut behind the goal into the scoring space. In general, as with
ultimate, its easiest to score by cutting into the space where you want the disc, not by already being there.</p>

<p>After the tourney, we went to a space-themed Halloween party, played a bunch of flipcup, ate delicious pie, and hoverboarded on PK&rsquo;s balance
board. I got home after 3am.</p>

    <p>After lot of team shifts and last-minute scrambling for players, we scraped together a squad to send to Clambake. I only knew half the team
going into the weekend, but they turned out to be a great bunch. We also had people drop and pick up as the tourney progressed. We ended up
winning all our pool games and making it all the way to semis before Silence of the Clams knocked us out. The weekend was cold and windy on
the whole, so a lot of games were upwind-downwind turnoverfests. Our &ldquo;bobbing for shots&rdquo; game went over really well during the day. The game
didnt make it to the party because we went hard pretty early and lost focus.</p>

    <p>3 days of ultimate with Metro North. Played 7 games total. Didn&rsquo;t play that great overall, but improved throughout the weekend. Best game was the last game against Wildcard.</p>

<p>In general, my main places to improve are fitness (as always), throwing, and switching my mindset from D to O. My biggest issue was too many bad throwing decisions after getting a turn. I play much better when I look for breaks and move the disc quickly, not try to huck it. I don&rsquo;t think I completed any hucks at all this weekend.</p>

<p>Btw, we finished 7th at nationals and qualified for the Pro Flight for next year.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Signed up last-minute for a hat tournament in Enfield (just north of Hartford). Ended up on Barb and Timmer&rsquo;s team. We started off weak, getting crushed in our first game. But then we dug in and won the next two pool games and three straight semis games to win the tourney. The final was us vs. the team we lost to first game. We were really tired (the day was HOT) and had lost some players to injury and concerts, so we picked up a few replacements. They also lost their best player, but picked up quality replacements as well. Victory was sweet, esp because we got a round of free wings for winning. I also met a bunch of cool CT ultimate players.</p>

    <p>In some ways the worst Wildwood yet. Cops were super annoying, got a $333 ticket for open display of alcohol. Played quite poorly most of the time.
Shrooms didn&rsquo;t do much. Diana wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>In another sense, tourney was pretty good. Weather was great - not scorching hot, not pouring rain. Cline&rsquo;s dance party at Stardust was sick. Stayed up
till 4am both nights, got quite drunk but wasn&rsquo;t hung over. Partied with lots of people I like. Played well against Rabs and Humiliswag. Saved a bunch of
money by sleeping in my car (the ppl whose house I slept in front of were not too happy). Chilled with Jennie, Barb, Robb and Max a good amount.</p>

    <p>Played a lot, esp on Saturday. Weather was super hot. Started off well, then went crazy and couldn&rsquo;t stop hucking it away. Sunday was hotter and more
humid, but we had a few subs and I felt way better. Didn&rsquo;t cramp at all, had 0 turns, played fairly well.</p>

<p>We beat Muff N' Men in the finals to win the tourney.</p>

    <p>Two days of fun in the sun with the sharkfuckers. Played 7 games with a
combined point diff of 94-45. Wasn&rsquo;t too tired because we didn&rsquo;t have that
many points to play. I had some silly turns of Sat but tightened it up on
Sunday. The finals was my best game - no turns, at least 4 assists, a
handful of Ds, and a hand block followed by a Rochester for the goal. We
won $1000, threw it in the air, swam in it naked and swaggered around as
much as we could.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Didn&rsquo;t do too much in the way of workouts conditioning. Mostly played ultimate:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 hours at a PoNY tryout. Didn&rsquo;t make the team.</li>
<li>2 days at Mixed Easterns with Metro North. Handled a lot.</li>
<li>1-day round-robin at Lums Pond in DE. Played against AG, AMP, Tyranis and Jug Handle. Also handled a good amount, primarily for the D line.</li>
<li>3 days at Windmill Windup with Cambridge. Played a lot against some good teams. Fairly happy with my play. Got one of the most difficult and awesome
layout Ds of my life.</li>
<li>4 days of beach ultimate at Bar Do Peixe. Definitely more relaxed that the rest of the tourneys, but still a lot of fun and pretty high quality. Played
a total of 11 games, though they were about half an hour each. Played with some awesome women, including probably the best girl in Portugal. Highlights
include my first layout handblock, a hammer handblock, some good D and strong intensity and focus under pressure (sometimes). Also ridiculous partying
every single night, especially Saturday and Sunday.</li>
</ul>


<p>Today, a return to real workouts. Threw with Miriam at Wooster Square for over an hour. Worked on torso torque on my flicks, spin on my leftie backhands, and flight path on my hammers.</p>
