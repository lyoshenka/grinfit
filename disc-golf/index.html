    <p>Played 18 holes of disc golf with the NH crew. I played with disc golf discs, worked on my throws. I noticed that I tend to release the
drivers early, which leads them to veer left. When I try to aim more right or release them later, I don&rsquo;t put enough OI on them and they
veer left because of that.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A day full of ultimate. In the morning, Justin and I played a hat tourney at Edgely. Team &ldquo;Favorite Nonalcoholic Beverage&rdquo; played three games. The first two were close but not that serious (we won the first, lost the second). The last game was against Dre and Billy&rsquo;s team, which got me really fired up to win. We didn&rsquo;t play well at first, but went on a strong 5-point run to take half. We held our lead through the second half (though they narrowed the gap) but gave up two breaks on universe point to lose the game. Most of our team was pretty young, but we also had a few more experienced players. It was a great mix and we had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>After the games, Justin, Maddie and I hit up Chipotle and then swung by Sedgely for a bit of disc golf. We met Panna and Billy at hole 3 and played till the 9th hole. Then Anna picked me up and we headed off to indoor spring league.</p>

<p>We had a double header against Dre&rsquo;s team and then Butter&rsquo;s team. The first game was close for the whole game, but in the 4th quarter we made a concerted effort to move the disc quickly and not try to huck it, which helped us score a few quick breaks in a row and win the game 37-31. The second game was tougher, with us trailing by 1 for most of the game. We took the lead sometimes, but we were pretty tired and didn&rsquo;t have enough discipline to pull out the win. They won 31-30, handing us our first loss of the season.</p>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m really sore.</p>

    <p>Went to the Spinners workout and scrimmage. The workout was pretty short, but the scrimmage was two hours long and we didn&rsquo;t have many subs. We played a few short games, then 8 quarters of 2 minutes each, then a normal game to 11. My game was the usual story: good cutting, poor throwing. It was pretty windy, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to doing a lot of throwing work.</p>

<p>After the workout, I biked to Sedgely and played disc golf for a 3 hours. I learned that to putt well, just throw it at the basket.</p>

    <p>Played 36 holes at Sedgly (18 from blue, back back 9, front 9 from yellow/red). I&rsquo;m still learning how the Comet works. It glides better but wants to go more left than the Shark. I had some nice drives but my putts still suck. That&rsquo;s by far the weakest part of my game. On the plus side, I hit the chains on 21 from the red on my first throw. I actually think it went in and bounced out, so that&rsquo;s the closest I&rsquo;ve come to a hole-in-one (also my first birdie from red).</p>

    <p>Wednesday: Disc golf at Sedgely. I played really well on the front 18. I was -2 for a long time and finished -1. I&rsquo;ve never even hit par before. The back back 9 went worse than usual, but we played the reds so that&rsquo;s to be expected. I think I was +3 for the back back (compared to -5 from the yellows the time before, but that was probably a major fluke).</p>

<p>Yesterday: Dodgeball playoffs. We&rsquo;re in the 5 through 8 bracket. I don&rsquo;t know what seed we are, but we won 7-3 last night so we&rsquo;re playing the 5v6 game next Thursday.</p>
