    <p>I stayed with Miriam on Sunday night after Pro Flight, and she invited me to play goalty with her team. At first I thought I&rsquo;d be too tired
and sore to play, but I decided to come out and see how it went. I ended up playing the whole time and had a blast. The people were fun and
we had the right number of subs - enough to feel fresh but not too many to stand around a lot. I&rsquo;m still learning goalty, so I made a bunch
of mistakes, but I did mack a disc for a goal and throw a Rochester for a goal that was dropped. Overall I noticed that people have a
tendency to all hang out in and around the goal, which makes scoring extra hard. I think more discipline to stay away from the arch would
create more space and make scoring easier.</p>

    <p>6 games across 2 days. We didn&rsquo;t have many players, and lost some to injury as the weekend went on, so I got a lot of reps. I tried out KT
tape for my knee, and am happy to report that it did not bother me at all on Saturday and only hurt a little on Sunday (whether this
correlation implies any causation or not, I still don&rsquo;t know). I had more turns and less Ds this weekend than I did in Colorado, but I also
had to handle more since Lucas wasn&rsquo;t there and Liz is out for the season. I esp played poorly against Amp and Drag'n Thrust, with several
turns in each game that were caused by rushing a throw - my main problem area. If we converted just a few more breaks, we could have won
those games (or at least kept them competitive).</p>

<p>I threw the longest huck for a goal of my life - an 80-yard endzone-to-endzone huck to Mari. To be fair my mark was slow to get set so I had
a wide-open backhand, but it&rsquo;s still a nice achievement.</p>

    <h2>Skillz</h2>

<p>4 Rounds for Time:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Rope Climb</li>
<li>8 Box Jumps @ 24"</li>
<li>6 Power Cleans @ 135lb (dropped to 115lb after the first round)</li>
<li>4 Renegade Rows @ 30lb</li>
<li>1 Rope Climb</li>
</ul>


<p>Rest 3:00 after each round.</p>

<p>My times: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">1</span>:<span class="number">52</span>, <span class="number">2</span>:<span class="number">02</span>, <span class="number">2</span>:<span class="number">05</span>, <span class="number">1</span>:<span class="number">55</span> </span></p>

<p>The rope climbs were tough but pretty fun. I burned my shin pretty hard on the first round. After that I found a wrist wrap and wrapped that
around my ankle. This really helped me from tearing up my shin any further, and let me come down faster on the climb down.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>CrossFit Games Open 12.1 (AMRAP - Reps)</p>

<p>AMRAP in 7min of burpees. On each burpee, touch a target 6" above your reach.</p>

<p>Got through <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">55</span> burpees </span>. I really focused on pace and breathing, but still came out a little too fast. I could have probably gotten
more if I tried harder to go slow in the first round. Then again, I was pretty beat from the first part of the workout, and I&rsquo;m pretty weak
on pushups in general.</p>

    <p>Went on a 3-day, 2-night hike in the mountains by Mestia, Georgia. The plan was to hike up to the Guli pass (Гульба), look over the edge,
then come down. But we started our hikes fairly late both days, so we missed the summit by about an hour or two (had to turn back in order
to make it down in time). I&rsquo;d never been on an all-out hike like this. We carried all our food and gear with us. We camped on the glacier
both nights (first night on the rocks embedded in the ice, second night on the snow/ice itself). We used helmets, crampons, harnesses, and
ice picks. It was pretty intense, but a lot of fun. The views were magnificent and the camaraderie was really gratifying. Plus it was great
to see my dad and his friends relive the good old days of &ldquo;extreme hiking&rdquo;, and to meet the next generation of explorers.</p>

<p>By the time we came down on day 3, I was thoroughly exhausted. I hadn&rsquo;t slept well for 3 nights (due to the cold, the snoring tentmates, and
the late-night partying). The descent was pretty challenging, and since I got down first, I went back twice to help the rest of the crew
with their packs. On the upside, my knee hurt a lot less than I expected. Maybe I need to reevaluate what triggers my tendonitis.</p>

    <p>Two days of ultimate at 6000ft. Actually, the altitude didn&rsquo;t bother me nearly as much as I thought it would. I felt fine the whole time. We
did bring a full roster, which helped keep everyone fresh and well-rested.</p>

<p>On the whole, a solid weekend for the team. We lost in the finals and played some games closer than we should have (e.g. Platypi,
Blackbird). But we also had a lot of good moments and some strong comebacks. Our D was especially solid, digging us out of holes a few
times.</p>

<p>Personally, I ended the weekend with a +3 on my score-o-meter (Ds minus turns). My only turn was my first throw of the tourney - a dump to
Lucas that I threw a bit too hard and too wide for him to get to. I think this might be my highest score in a few years. I must be getting
old. I even called a timeout once.</p>

<p>Off the field, this was one of the best tourneys we&rsquo;ve had. Hanging out with Squeege and others in CO was great. The highlight was our
2-hour-long game of Crazy Grapes in Squeege&rsquo;s pool. I also went motown dancing, explored downtown Denver, celebrated Kerry&rsquo;s birthday,
played Dominion, and watched lots of people catch lots of Pokemon.</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>4x3+2 Push Press + Jerk, building</li>
<li>4x12 Barbell Russian Twist, building</li>
</ul>


<p>Got up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">125</span>lb </span> for the presses, <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>lb </span> for the twists. I&rsquo;d never done twists with the bar before, and didn&rsquo;t really have time
to do many.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time (8min Cap):</p>

<ul>
<li>100 total Russian Twist with a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>lb </span> plate</li>
<li>50 Push Press @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">65</span>lb </span></li>
<li><del>400m Sprint</del> 20cal on the Air Bike</li>
</ul>


<p>I finished in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span>:<span class="number">40</span> </span>. The push presses killed me, even though I scaled down from 75lb. I did the twists really fast (nonstop) and
crushed the air bike in 40 seconds, but struggled on the presses. At the end I was doing 2 or 3 at a time, dropping the bar to my waist,
then cleaning it back up and doing a few more. It was rough.</p>

<h2>Summer League</h2>

<p>After the WOD, I went straight to summer league. I&rsquo;m glad I did that, because we didn&rsquo;t get to play much - games got rained out right before
halftime. It really sucked, because our team was only playing with 6 players at a time (we only had 2 women) and we were up 5-3 when the
games got called. If only we&rsquo;d played a few points, we could have earned a win playing 6 v 7. On the plus side, I got to go home early :-)</p>

<p>15 minutes of Push Press. Work up to a heavy triple.</p>

<p>I maxed out at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">3</span>@<span class="number">145</span>lb </span>. I got 2@155lb on the following set but missed the 3rd rep :-(</p>

<h2>Skill</h2>

<p>6min EMOM: 6 Box Jumps at a challenging height.</p>

<p>I started at 30in but bumped up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">33</span>in </span> after the second set. I was finishing all 6 in about 20 seconds each time.</p>

<h2>WOD 1</h2>

<p>3min AMRAP:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Push Press @ 55% of max weight from part 1</li>
<li>1 Box Jump @ 30in</li>
<li>2 Push Presses</li>
<li>2 Box Jumps</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>


<p>I got through exactly <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">7</span> rounds </span> in 3min.</p>

<p>After a 3min rest, we did&hellip;</p>

<h2>WOD 2</h2>

<p>Same as WOD 1, but in reverse. Start where you finished the first WOD (that&rsquo;s 7 reps of each for me) and work your way down. The goal is to
finish everything from WOD 1 in 3 minutes.</p>

<p>I managed to do this WOD even faster than the first one. Finished in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">2</span>:<span class="number">50</span> </span>, 10 seconds to spare.</p>

<p>This was a fun workout.</p>

covered by Brendan, a captain of Colt. He did a good job making me work hard to get open, which is exactly the kind of thing that&rsquo;s usually
missing in summer league. Glad I came to this game.</p>

    <h2>Strength</h2>

<p>15 min of Overhead Squat, working up to a heavy triple. I got up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">85</span>lb </span> and probably could have kept going but ran out of time.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>This was supposed to be a Jump Rope tabata, but I can&rsquo;t jump so I subbed in a bunch of stuff:</p>

<p>Two rounds through of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Max Cals on Air Bike</li>
<li>Slamballs</li>
<li>Goblet Squats with Slamball</li>
<li>Russian Twists with Slamball</li>
</ul>


<p>I used a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span> slamball. I didn&rsquo;t count the reps, but I got through about 12 slams, 12-13 squats, and 24-26 twists.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>AMRAP. 4 rounds of:</p>

<p>With 2:00 on the clock:</p>

<ul>
<li>40m OH Walking Lunge Steps</li>
<li>Remaining time: max cals on the air bike</li>
</ul>


<p>Rest 1:00 between rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Right at the end of the 4th round (at min. 11), complete 30 seconds of max slam balls. Each slam ball counts as 5 cals.</p>

<p>I got <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">24</span> cals </span> on the air bike and <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">13</span> slam balls </span>.</p>

    <p>Another glorious OMK is in the books. Highlights from the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Darts and credit card roulette for spin-the-wheel on Friday = 4 hours of sleep</li>
<li>First point of Saturday - we have 4 players there on time</li>
<li>Pool(tub) of shame</li>
<li>Gooch wears a $90 shark wrestling singlet</li>
<li>Games got rained out around noon on Sat</li>
<li>Circling the wagons, playing dice and drinking, car-swapping relay races</li>
<li>Front seat must be naked</li>
<li>Day drinking and pizza box at Mike&rsquo;s</li>
<li>No one is allowed to take off clothes when they shower</li>
<li>Dinner with Seth &amp; Jennie</li>
<li>Anti-thumper at Wolff&rsquo;s</li>
<li>After-party at Liz&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house</li>
<li>First game on sunday - opponents warm up for half an hour, we win 13-4</li>
<li>Tom Kirby&rsquo;s 15-year-old son Jack picks up with us for the day. He&rsquo;s pretty good for being 15.</li>
<li>Second game - we fall behind pretty hard, rally the troups, eke out a win</li>
<li>I throw Dana a terrible floaty huck, do my penance by drinking a sip from the pool of shame</li>
<li>Squirt-gun shootout with a 4-year-old</li>
<li>Semis - game is very upwind/downwind, we can&rsquo;t catch a disc in the endzone to save our lives, lose 13-9</li>
<li>Last point of semis: I catch a nice half-field throw from Brown, dish it, drop the next pass. Handler picks up, I handblock his hammer,
cut to the endzone. Brown throws to my S-cut, it gets Ded, I lay out a million feet to catch it. Rush to stand up and throw the goal, get
footblocked. About 30 seconds of my highest highs and lowest lows for the day.</li>
<li>I threw and caught at least 1 Rochester each</li>
<li>Post-tourney burgers at Jumping Jacks, grilling at Liz&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s, home by 8pm</li>

    <p>6 games over 3 days at the US Open. We did really well, winning our pool (despite a last-game loss to Polar Bears) and then losing a close
game to Slow in the semis. Personally, I wasn&rsquo;t at the top of my game because my toe was killing me, but it actually got better throughout
the weekend and I played my best game against Slow. I even got a shoutout after games on Saturday for continuing to cut hard even late in
the day/tournament.</p>

<p>Besides the ultimate, I had a lot of fun hanging out with the team. We drank beer, went swimming in the ocean, played games, watched
ultimate, and enjoyed each others company. It was a great start to the season.</p>

    <p>Low-key summer league game. I wasn&rsquo;t gonna go but decided it&rsquo;s good to move
around some. Ended up being great weather and the ideal amount of running.
Even my messed up toenail wasn&rsquo;t a problem (good to know for this weekend).</p>

    <p>Two long, hot days of ultimate with not many subs. The D line guys were practically savage all weekend, especially Saturday. DJ left halfway
into the second game, so the four of us (Lucas, Billy YoungJo, and I) played every D point after that. Occaisionally one or two others would
sub in and help out, but that was basically it. On top of that, I did a bad job taking care of myself (not enough water, salt and sunblock, not
enough sleep and food the day before). In one of the very last points of the fourth game, I cramped up super-hard (both hamstrings and a
calf) and had to lie on the ground for 10 min before I could get up again. Thankfully the game ended and we were done for the day.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I took extra care to eat and drink a lot (I also ice-showered the night before), and felt way better. We were still low on
numbers, but DJ returned and John G&rsquo;s hamstring felt better so he played a few points. Despite playing the whole previous day, I felt less
tired after Sunday than I did after Saturday. The caffeine and electrolyte pills probably helped too.</p>

<p>Game-wise, I guess I played well. I&rsquo;m not happy about my lack of forced Ds and how tired I felt, but its hard to compare that to a normal
game where I&rsquo;ll have proper subs. I didn&rsquo;t throw many turnovers, which is great for me, but I did make several fatigue-induced mistakes (not
helping out on a few discs, getting beat upline, dropping two discs that I had my hands on, some throwaways). Then again, I played solid
defense the vast majority of the time. Even in the last game, I stuck close to my guy a lot and ran a few nice switches with Billy. I guess
my main problem was summoning the will to cut hard after a turn, esp late in the day. On the points where I forced myself to go hard, we
usually did well and scored quickly. On the points where I was too tired, it was hard to make things happen. I gained a lot of respect for
the other guys on the line (esp Billy) and their nonstop effort after turns.</p>

<p>I picked up a few minor injuries (a bruise under my big toe nail, some soreness in my tendons), but my tendonitis doesnt seem to be
bothering me today. I hope it still feels good after US Open next week, and continues to hold throughout the season.</p>

    <p>Played a close game against Alex Morrone&rsquo;s team. We started off slow but came back at the end to win it 16-14. I played an ok amount at
first, but then played most of the last few points to bring us back on top and take the win.</p>

<p>Straight from there, drove to Porcfest for two days of camping, LBRY and freedom.</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Overhead Squats, building to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">75</span>lb </span></li>
<li>8/side Dead Bugs</li>
</ul>


<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time (9:00 cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>12-9-6-9-12 Overhead Squats</li>
<li>30 Bicycle Kicks (15/side) after each set of squats</li>
</ul>


<p>I just used a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">45</span>lb </span> bar for the squats, but probably should have gone heavier. I went of my calculated 1RM on the squats, but it was
probably somewhat old and I&rsquo;ve gotten stronger since then.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<h3>Support Holds On Box (5 x 30sec)</h3>

<p>Arms fully locked out, pits of elbows forward, shoulder blades pulled back and down.  Keep torso upright, stay tight. Rest 30 seconds
between efforts.</p>

<h3>Push Ups (4 x 8)</h3>

<p>2 second hold at top (hollow position) and at the bottom.  Rest 30 seconds between sets</p>

<h3>Arch Hold With PVC (4 sets for max time)</h3>

<p>Rest as needed between efforts.</p>

<h3>Box Dips (Foot Assisted) (3 x 10)</h3>

<p>Use feet to help with the movement so as not to overload the shoulder.  Elbows stay tight to body, chest upright, tight core.  Rest 30
seconds between sets.</p>

<h3>Squat Holds (5 x 30-60sec hold)</h3>

<p>This is an active hold, not a stretch.  Perform an air squat and hold the bottom. Fight for upright torso position.  Rest as long as you
were able to hold.</p>
