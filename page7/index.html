    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>4x3+2 Push Press + Jerk, building</li>
<li>4x12 Barbell Russian Twist, building</li>
</ul>


<p>Got up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">125</span>lb </span> for the presses, <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>lb </span> for the twists. I&rsquo;d never done twists with the bar before, and didn&rsquo;t really have time
to do many.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time (8min Cap):</p>

<ul>
<li>100 total Russian Twist with a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>lb </span> plate</li>
<li>50 Push Press @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">65</span>lb </span></li>
<li><del>400m Sprint</del> 20cal on the Air Bike</li>
</ul>


<p>I finished in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">6</span>:<span class="number">40</span> </span>. The push presses killed me, even though I scaled down from 75lb. I did the twists really fast (nonstop) and
crushed the air bike in 40 seconds, but struggled on the presses. At the end I was doing 2 or 3 at a time, dropping the bar to my waist,
then cleaning it back up and doing a few more. It was rough.</p>

<h2>Summer League</h2>

<p>After the WOD, I went straight to summer league. I&rsquo;m glad I did that, because we didn&rsquo;t get to play much - games got rained out right before
halftime. It really sucked, because our team was only playing with 6 players at a time (we only had 2 women) and we were up 5-3 when the
games got called. If only we&rsquo;d played a few points, we could have earned a win playing 6 v 7. On the plus side, I got to go home early :-)</p>

<p>15 minutes of Push Press. Work up to a heavy triple.</p>

<p>I maxed out at <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">3</span>@<span class="number">145</span>lb </span>. I got 2@155lb on the following set but missed the 3rd rep :-(</p>

<h2>Skill</h2>

<p>6min EMOM: 6 Box Jumps at a challenging height.</p>

<p>I started at 30in but bumped up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">33</span>in </span> after the second set. I was finishing all 6 in about 20 seconds each time.</p>

<h2>WOD 1</h2>

<p>3min AMRAP:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Push Press @ 55% of max weight from part 1</li>
<li>1 Box Jump @ 30in</li>
<li>2 Push Presses</li>
<li>2 Box Jumps</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>


<p>I got through exactly <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">7</span> rounds </span> in 3min.</p>

<p>After a 3min rest, we did&hellip;</p>

<h2>WOD 2</h2>

<p>Same as WOD 1, but in reverse. Start where you finished the first WOD (that&rsquo;s 7 reps of each for me) and work your way down. The goal is to
finish everything from WOD 1 in 3 minutes.</p>

<p>I managed to do this WOD even faster than the first one. Finished in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">2</span>:<span class="number">50</span> </span>, 10 seconds to spare.</p>

<p>This was a fun workout.</p>

    <p>Pretty easy summer league game. It was quite windy and they had a lot of trouble with our zone. I spent most of thet time covering and being
covered by Brendan, a captain of Colt. He did a good job making me work hard to get open, which is exactly the kind of thing that&rsquo;s usually
missing in summer league. Glad I came to this game.</p>

    <h2>Strength</h2>

<p>15 min of Overhead Squat, working up to a heavy triple. I got up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">85</span>lb </span> and probably could have kept going but ran out of time.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>This was supposed to be a Jump Rope tabata, but I can&rsquo;t jump so I subbed in a bunch of stuff:</p>

<p>Two rounds through of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Max Cals on Air Bike</li>
<li>Slamballs</li>
<li>Goblet Squats with Slamball</li>
<li>Russian Twists with Slamball</li>
</ul>


<p>I used a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span> slamball. I didn&rsquo;t count the reps, but I got through about 12 slams, 12-13 squats, and 24-26 twists.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>AMRAP. 4 rounds of:</p>

<p>With 2:00 on the clock:</p>

<ul>
<li>40m OH Walking Lunge Steps</li>
<li>Remaining time: max cals on the air bike</li>
</ul>


<p>Rest 1:00 between rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Right at the end of the 4th round (at min. 11), complete 30 seconds of max slam balls. Each slam ball counts as 5 cals.</p>

<p>I got <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">24</span> cals </span> on the air bike and <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">13</span> slam balls </span>.</p>

    <p>Another glorious OMK is in the books. Highlights from the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Darts and credit card roulette for spin-the-wheel on Friday = 4 hours of sleep</li>
<li>First point of Saturday - we have 4 players there on time</li>
<li>Pool(tub) of shame</li>
<li>Gooch wears a $90 shark wrestling singlet</li>
<li>Games got rained out around noon on Sat</li>
<li>Circling the wagons, playing dice and drinking, car-swapping relay races</li>
<li>Front seat must be naked</li>
<li>Day drinking and pizza box at Mike&rsquo;s</li>
<li>No one is allowed to take off clothes when they shower</li>
<li>Dinner with Seth &amp; Jennie</li>
<li>Anti-thumper at Wolff&rsquo;s</li>
<li>After-party at Liz&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house</li>
<li>First game on sunday - opponents warm up for half an hour, we win 13-4</li>
<li>Tom Kirby&rsquo;s 15-year-old son Jack picks up with us for the day. He&rsquo;s pretty good for being 15.</li>
<li>Second game - we fall behind pretty hard, rally the troups, eke out a win</li>
<li>I throw Dana a terrible floaty huck, do my penance by drinking a sip from the pool of shame</li>
<li>Squirt-gun shootout with a 4-year-old</li>
<li>Semis - game is very upwind/downwind, we can&rsquo;t catch a disc in the endzone to save our lives, lose 13-9</li>
<li>Last point of semis: I catch a nice half-field throw from Brown, dish it, drop the next pass. Handler picks up, I handblock his hammer,
cut to the endzone. Brown throws to my S-cut, it gets Ded, I lay out a million feet to catch it. Rush to stand up and throw the goal, get
footblocked. About 30 seconds of my highest highs and lowest lows for the day.</li>
<li>I threw and caught at least 1 Rochester each</li>
<li>Post-tourney burgers at Jumping Jacks, grilling at Liz&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s, home by 8pm</li>

    <p>6 games over 3 days at the US Open. We did really well, winning our pool (despite a last-game loss to Polar Bears) and then losing a close
game to Slow in the semis. Personally, I wasn&rsquo;t at the top of my game because my toe was killing me, but it actually got better throughout
the weekend and I played my best game against Slow. I even got a shoutout after games on Saturday for continuing to cut hard even late in
the day/tournament.</p>

<p>Besides the ultimate, I had a lot of fun hanging out with the team. We drank beer, went swimming in the ocean, played games, watched
ultimate, and enjoyed each others company. It was a great start to the season.</p>

    <p>Two long, hot days of ultimate with not many subs. The D line guys were practically savage all weekend, especially Saturday. DJ left halfway
into the second game, so the four of us (Lucas, Billy YoungJo, and I) played every D point after that. Occaisionally one or two others would
sub in and help out, but that was basically it. On top of that, I did a bad job taking care of myself (not enough water, salt and sunblock, not
enough sleep and food the day before). In one of the very last points of the fourth game, I cramped up super-hard (both hamstrings and a
calf) and had to lie on the ground for 10 min before I could get up again. Thankfully the game ended and we were done for the day.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I took extra care to eat and drink a lot (I also ice-showered the night before), and felt way better. We were still low on
numbers, but DJ returned and John G&rsquo;s hamstring felt better so he played a few points. Despite playing the whole previous day, I felt less
tired after Sunday than I did after Saturday. The caffeine and electrolyte pills probably helped too.</p>

<p>Game-wise, I guess I played well. I&rsquo;m not happy about my lack of forced Ds and how tired I felt, but its hard to compare that to a normal
game where I&rsquo;ll have proper subs. I didn&rsquo;t throw many turnovers, which is great for me, but I did make several fatigue-induced mistakes (not
helping out on a few discs, getting beat upline, dropping two discs that I had my hands on, some throwaways). Then again, I played solid
defense the vast majority of the time. Even in the last game, I stuck close to my guy a lot and ran a few nice switches with Billy. I guess
my main problem was summoning the will to cut hard after a turn, esp late in the day. On the points where I forced myself to go hard, we
usually did well and scored quickly. On the points where I was too tired, it was hard to make things happen. I gained a lot of respect for
the other guys on the line (esp Billy) and their nonstop effort after turns.</p>

<p>I picked up a few minor injuries (a bruise under my big toe nail, some soreness in my tendons), but my tendonitis doesnt seem to be
bothering me today. I hope it still feels good after US Open next week, and continues to hold throughout the season.</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Overhead Squats, building to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">75</span>lb </span></li>
<li>8/side Dead Bugs</li>
</ul>


<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>For Time (9:00 cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>12-9-6-9-12 Overhead Squats</li>
<li>30 Bicycle Kicks (15/side) after each set of squats</li>
</ul>


<p>I just used a <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">45</span>lb </span> bar for the squats, but probably should have gone heavier. I went of my calculated 1RM on the squats, but it was
probably somewhat old and I&rsquo;ve gotten stronger since then.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<h3>Support Holds On Box (5 x 30sec)</h3>

<p>Arms fully locked out, pits of elbows forward, shoulder blades pulled back and down.  Keep torso upright, stay tight. Rest 30 seconds
between efforts.</p>

<h3>Push Ups (4 x 8)</h3>

<p>2 second hold at top (hollow position) and at the bottom.  Rest 30 seconds between sets</p>

<h3>Arch Hold With PVC (4 sets for max time)</h3>

<p>Rest as needed between efforts.</p>

<h3>Box Dips (Foot Assisted) (3 x 10)</h3>

<p>Use feet to help with the movement so as not to overload the shoulder.  Elbows stay tight to body, chest upright, tight core.  Rest 30
seconds between sets.</p>

<h3>Squat Holds (5 x 30-60sec hold)</h3>

<p>This is an active hold, not a stretch.  Perform an air squat and hold the bottom. Fight for upright torso position.  Rest as long as you
were able to hold.</p>

    <p>90 min of goalty at Miriam&rsquo;s going-away party. We played double-goal goalty for the first time. It was fun, though I prefer single-goal
because its encourages better defense. With two goals, you expect to get scored on so you hang back to protect against the fast break on the
way back. So you don&rsquo;t always sprint to get back and protect your goal. Besides that, it was a great time.</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<p>5 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 Back Squats @ 70% 1RM</li>
<li>8 Barbell Bicep Curls</li>
</ul>


<p>My 1RM is never really that accurate. I did my first set at 155lb, then bumped it up to <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">165</span>lb </span> for the rest. Curls were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">55</span>lb </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 Rounds for Time (8:00 Time Cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>15 Wall Balls @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span></li>
<li>10 KB Swings @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">53</span>lb </span></li>
<li>10 Chin Ups (or 5 Ring Muscle Ups)</li>
</ul>


<p>I came very close to finishing it all in 8 min, but missed by a bit. I got through all the wall balls and 4 swings on the last round before
time ran out. The chin ups were pretty tough. I think I kept putting my hands too wide on the bar to facilitate kipping, but then I didn&rsquo;t
get a good enough grip on it. I also tried out these new grips that they had at the gym to keep my calluses from ripping, but that made it
harder to hold onto the kettlebell and the wall ball.</p>

    <h2>Strength</h2>

<p>6 rounds of Snatch Complex. Start a round every 90 seconds. One round is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lift Off</li>
<li>Snatch Pull</li>
<li>Snatch High Pull</li>
<li>Power Snatch</li>
</ul>


<p>I started with 65lb and went up to 75lb halfway through. The goal was to focus on form, not get a high weight. I still have trouble with the
bar following the correct path on the way up (not hitting my knees, touching my thighs).</p>

<h2>Abs</h2>

<p>Tabata Abs. Two rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>AbMat Sit-ups</li>
<li>Tuck Ups</li>
<li>Russian Twists @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">25</span>lb </span></li>
<li>Bicycle Kicks</li>
</ul>


<p>My numbers were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">16</span>,<span class="number">16</span>,<span class="number">26</span>,<span class="number">38</span>,<span class="number">13</span>,<span class="number">13</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">20</span> </span> for a total of <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">162</span> reps </span>.</p>

<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 rounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 Total DB Snatches @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">40</span>lb </span></li>
<li>6cals on the assault bike (subbed for 8 10m Line Touches)</li>
<li>8 Slam Balls @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">20</span>lb </span></li>
<li>max reps Russian Twists w/ Slam Ball</li>
</ul>


<p>You have 1:30 to do each round. Your score is the number of Russian Twists you get through. Rest 1:30 between rounds.</p>

<p>I started with a 35lb DB, but went up to 40lb after the first round because I got a lot of twists in. My numbers were <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">27</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">20</span>,<span class="number">0</span> </span>.
The bike on the last round really killed me. I biked super slow and used up all my time. I just finished the slam balls as time expired.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<p>I missed two weeks of the gymnastics program, so I&rsquo;m doing week 2&rsquo;s workouts now. I didn&rsquo;t do everything because I was tired, but I got in</p>

<ul>
<li>3x6 Slow Pushups (3 seconds down, 3 seconds up)</li>
<li>3x10 Squats with Feet Together</li>
<li>4x20sec Forward Leaning Hold</li>
</ul>

    <p>7 games across 2 days at Windmill. Played the Portuguese and Polish
nationals teams, club teams from all over Europe, a team from Israel, and
one US-ish pickup team. We were very solid for a pickup team, but were
inconsistent and plagued with injuries. Finished 17th with a 4-4 record - a
lot of close losses and hard-fought games.</p>

<p>Personal highlights include a big layout D, several nice hucks, solid
handling and cutting all around, and some good lessons learned about
leadership (mostly: if the team expects you to lead, you have to lead. Even
if you like to keep it loose, you are in charge and need to provide
direction)</p>

<p>The best part of windmill is, or course, the people. Our whole team was
talented, extremely friendly and nice. The Portuguese team was awesome (my
fav game, I think) and I saw a bunch of BDP friends. I also made some new
friends that I hope to see again sometime. Maybe windmill &lsquo;17?</p>

    <h2>Strength / Skill Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>3x16 Suitcase Walking Lunge Step @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">35</span>,<span class="number">40</span>,<span class="number">45</span>lb </span></li>
<li>Butterfly Pullup work. I&rsquo;m basically there, just need to get the tempo and leg movement down so I can do them repeatedly without swinging
wildly.</li>
</ul>


<h2>WOD</h2>

<p>4 Rounds For Time (17min Cap)</p>

<ul>
<li>20 Pullups</li>
<li>20 Goblet Squats @ <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">30</span>lb </span></li>
<li>10cal Assault Bike (subbed for 40 double-unders)</li>
</ul>


<p>I did kipping pullups for the first two rounds, but completely tore up my hands in the process. So I switched to SVPUs for the last two
rounds. I finished the workout in <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">13</span>:<span class="number">59</span> </span></p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>

<ul>
<li>3x8 Supine-grip Ring Rows: Slow pull (no snaking or jerking) with a 2 second hold at the top. Rest 60 seconds between sets.</li>
<li>5x60sec Bottom-of-Squat Hold: Rest as long as you were able to hold. Fight for upright torso position.</li>
<li>5x Chin-over-bar Hold for max time: Stay hollow at the top, use a band only if absolutely necessary. Rest as needed between efforts.</li>
<li>4x10 per side One-Legged Box Squats: No rest, just switch sides.</li>
<li>4x30-60sec Plank on Elbows</li>
</ul>


<p>The gymnastics work was pretty brutal today because it was almost exactly the same thing we did during the WOD. I couldn&rsquo;t even do the
chin-over-bar hangs because my hands were dead. The ring rows were really hard as well. The rest of the workout was decent. I killed squat
holds and did fairly well on box squats (though I didn&rsquo;t know the focus was on going slow and balancing). I hit 45sec on each plank.</p>
