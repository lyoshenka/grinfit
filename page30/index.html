    <p>An awesome 2 hours. We did some short stretches and drills, then scrimmaged a lot. First drill was a give-and-go drill with 3 stationary receivers and one cutter running down the middle of the field. I liked the drill, but I&rsquo;m unsure about the in-game usefulness. Going from catch to throw quickly was good practice. But when I try to do this move in a real game, the hardest part is throwing to a moving cutter while also moving.</p>

<p>After that drill and a 1-on-1 cutting in space drill, we played a bunch of scrimmages. For the first few, we were not allowed to throw the disc backwards. For the last few, it was just standard indoor ultimate with a slightly longer stall count.</p>

<p>I need to match up against Papa more.</p>

    <p>Played a few fun games at SJ&rsquo;s indoor hat tourney. My team was a bit stacked because I was a maybe and the team was meant to be decent even without me. But we ended up very strong, with several good club guys and some strong ladies too. We won our first two games pretty easily, then played a close game against Trey&rsquo;s team where we were down the whole time but came back at the end to win 14-12. In the finals, we played against another stacked team from the B pool: Billy Maroon, Izzy, a few tall dudes and some ladies that knew how to get open in the endzone. We trailed the whole time again, but closed the gap at the end. We lost by only 2 points.</p>

<p>A lot of people from the previous weekend&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s tourney came back out for this. It was fun to play with some of the guys I played against the last time.</p>

    <p>Played a really fun and really high-level indoor tournament at MapleZone. There were 5 teams of about equal caliber:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rabs + Trey</li>
<li>Heva Havas + Roots</li>
<li>Med Men + Mazur</li>
<li>Spank</li>
<li>Amp + Hypnotoad + UDel + Termites (us)</li>
</ul>


<p>About a third of the team was from our Entrapment indoor nationals crew (me, Chappers, Ducky, Weez, and Keg), and I&rsquo;d played with many of the guys on Amp, but the UDel guys (Charles and Brian) were new to me. They both played well, each with at least one really nice sky. Josh also had some amazing moments, including breaking through a secret door in the endzone after a big sky. But despite the uncomfortable amounts of FUN we were having, we only went 1-3.</p>

<p>Despite our record, I&rsquo;m very happy with the weekend. All the teams were very evenly matched and we lost our games by 3 points or less. The team we beat went on to lose in the finals against Trabs. 3 teams were tied 2-2 and had the exact same point diff.</p>

<p>Oh yea. We had a hawk disc. We scored at least one goal with it, after which the other team made us swap the disc out. They lost. Don&rsquo;t mess with the hawk. Just hawk it!</p>

    <p>Played against Dre&rsquo;s team and Satell&rsquo;s team. I&rsquo;m becoming more convinced that a team playing their second game back-to-back is better off than their opponents who are on their first game (assuming the double header team has good numbers). We lost to Dre&rsquo;s team by 2 and beat Satell&rsquo;s team by 2, though we were up 6 on Satell in the 4th quarter and started to get lazy. Dre&rsquo;s team played well and did a great job poaching against us. Satell&rsquo;s team was on their first game of the season (we were on our 3rd), so that may have had something to do with their loss, but they also lacked strong women to match their very strong men. I think they&rsquo;ll get better as the season goes on.</p>

<p>On the way home, we saw the train leave the platform right as we got there. Adam did some baller driving to get me to the next station right as the train got there. So fast, so furious.</p>

    <p>I won the Green Jacket in my best game of frolf ever. I was -3 after 3 holes with a birdie on 1 and a mulligan-to-eagle on 3. I managed to maintain that score and par the rest of the holes, though it got hairy at times. I had a bit of a scare on 8 but managed to save par by sliding a scoober along the gravel and under a large bush. I could have even better if I didn&rsquo;t screw up the 7th and 8th holes (especially the 7th), and I was in great position to attempt a birdie on 9 but Steve convinced me to play it safe and take the win instead of trying to get fancy.</p>

After the game, we went out to Goat Hollow, which was pretty cool except for the loud guy playing guitar and singing.</p>

    <p>Two days of moshing around with Johnny Pivotfoot and the 10 Stallcounts. Made it to the finals this year, but couldn&rsquo;t close the deal. Probably not enough Pick 6s. I played a bunch, especially in the semis and finals on Sunday. I think my hucks and defense were my main issues, though I got a few good Ds and even had a nice box-out (though on O) that I&rsquo;m usually bad at. I was really impressed with Brown and Kristen. They played a lot and maintained a high level throughout. Dorko&rsquo;s defense was inspirational. Colin&rsquo;s scoobers were pretty and pinpoint. I missed Ross and Finkbot and Amy and Dusty. Kendra had one of the best Ds of the weekend. The tall-guys/short-girls line, the short-girls/tall-guys line and the Grant/Grin/Graham line all scored their point. Shelley fed us 40lbs of chicken. What more could I ask for.</p>

<p>Well, I could ask for fewer stupid turns. The one I threw way out the back on a huck to Kendra. The one that got Ded in the endzone because I rushed it. The bad bladey break to Shelley that should have been an IO backhand goal. The poor huck to Brown that could have easily been a goal. The dishie in the zone to Venose that should have gone to his other shoulder. The I-didnt-warm-up-enough turn to Kristen on the very first point on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The D I blinked on in the semis in the back corner of the endzone. The D on Zumba - just box him out. The one Dre threw right by my head. The IO huck I gave up first point of the finals, and the throw before that which I could have Ded if I reacted faster. The big upfield backhand that Alex broke me with - too much straightup. All the Pick 6s I forgot to run back.</p>
