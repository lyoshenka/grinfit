  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played our first USAU Triple Crown event - the Philly Invite. The top teams in the country were in attendance - teams 5-16 from nationals last year. This was our first weekend as a full team with a finalized roster, and we stepped up our game bigtime. We took second in our pool with a 4-1 record (beating Odyssee, Mental Toss, Slow White and 7 Figures, and losing to CLX), which put us in the championship bracket. In semis, we took down Ghosts on a universe point goal. Then in finals, we avenged our loss to CLX and won first place. On the whole, everyone played very well. Birdo and Papa especially stood out for low turnovers, a lot of Ds, tons of goals (Birdo) and strong play against tough matchups (Papa vs Stout). Personally I played ok, but I had too many turnovers (even though Butter said some of them were good turns) and was not feeling 100% strong on Saturday (don&rsquo;t know if it was the heat or my 2 weeks in Africa).</p>

<p>Firsts:</p>

<ul>
<li>My first real club tournament win ever.</li>
<li>AMP&rsquo;s first tourney win since 2009.</li>
<li>First time AMP beat Slow White and Ghosts (at least the first time since I started playing with AMP).</li>
<li>My first between-the-legs goal (against Todd Herman - game winner vs Slow White).</li>
<li>First time in many years that I seriously cramped up while playing - both calves, right shin, right bicep.</li>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Spent two weeks in Tanzania. The first week, we hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro. Most of the hike was pretty easy and we were pampered quite a bit. I felt like a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lyoshenka/9318771865">British explorer</a> - having a tea break before dinner and being around green canvas tents all the time. The summit night, however, was the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done in my life. We woke up at midnight, ate a small meal, and spent the next six and a half hours getting to the top. It was dark, cold (below 0F) and there wasn&rsquo;t much oxygen. I felt fine at the start (4800m above sea level) but after a few hours, walking became pretty difficult. The cold didn&rsquo;t bother me as much, but the lack of oxygen was rough. I spent most of the second half of the climb just focusing on walking slowly. I was mentally repeating &ldquo;left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot&rdquo; to keep focused. As we neared the first summit (Stella Point), the sun started to rise. When I got there, it was glorious. I was (almost) at the roof of Africa. We took a short break to drink some tea with sugar, then continued on to the real summit (Uhuru Peak), which was over an hour away and 200m higher. This section was not as bad as getting to Stella Point because it was warmer, less steep and the end was in sight. At the peak, we took another short break and a bunch of pictures (including a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lyoshenka/9318842727">mandatory handstand pic</a> for me). Then we started our descent. Back at Stella Point, we took a few more pictures before heading back to camp. The descent took about an hour and a half. Then we slept for a bit, ate a little and went down another few hundred meters to a lower camp to make sure we don&rsquo;t get altitude sickness.</p>

    <p>Played a short game in the rain. Edgely was swamped so we moved to the Belmont Plateau fields. Ended up only playing to 9 because it got dark. It was very rainy and wet, so throwing and catching was tough for everyone. Gloves would definitely have helped, especially because our deep game was lacking. I threw several good backhand hucks but every flick huck attempt slipped out of my hand and fluttered to the ground. The game was close the whole way through, but Ditz&rsquo;s team scored a late break to go up 8-7 and &ldquo;take half&rdquo;, so they received again and scored that to win 9-7.</p>

<p>Afterwards Vinny, Jean and I ran some shuffle-sprints. We did 8 total: 4 normal ones and 4 out-in-alltheway. We drank beer and ate carnitas and stayed up till 3am.</p>

    <p>4 hours of practice at Edgely. We spent a lot of time scrimmaging with a focus on defense. We tried several poachy defenses, different marks and downfield positioning. We also spent a little time on reading/catching hucks and throwing deep to women. My defense was not the best and I turned over a wide-open away throw to a girl. I was better on offense: cutting was pretty smooth and I threw a nice huck. Need to work on fitness and quickness more.</p>

    <p>Played a game against Raynor&rsquo;s team. We jumped out to an 8-4 lead at halftime, but then lost our focus and the game (16-14). Our O looked pretty disorganized during the second half. We weren&rsquo;t getting good cuts and our dumps were not clicking. There were moments when we played really well, especially near the endzone. But overall, not our best game. Personally I threw away way too many discs. I <em>really</em> need to learn discretion if I&rsquo;m gonna handle.</p>

<p>After games, we did Ben&rsquo;s 25m shuffle workout. We ran 8 shuffles. I ran each in 25 or 26 seconds. I also did 30 burpees over the course of the evening: 10 after our game, 10 before winning the fields, 10 after.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The legendary Poultry Days tournament. Camping, carnival, chicken, beer, partying, chicken, ultimate and lots of chicken. The team names are chicken-themed, dinner is chicken and even the brick marks are chickens. The weather was awesome all weekend and the level of play varied from really low (I think we bageled our first opponents) to top-notch (finals was Team USA vs Team Canada). We had a relatively easy Saturday, only facing one team (Breasts and Thighs) that really gave us a game. But we pulled out a win to finish the day 5-0 and earn a first-round bye on Sunday. We also fit in a game of SpikeJam and many many games of Spikeball.</p>

<p>After games, we hosed off, got dinner and watched the USA vs Canada showcase game while drinking tequilla mango smoothies and spikeballing at halftime. The rest of the night was approximately this: cricken/middlebury with Duke, brief visit to the carnival for beer, return to fields for the dance party, back to campsite, bed.</p>

<p>Sunday started off with a big breakfast of bagels, biscuits + gravy, and fruit cups. We won our first game was against Tad&rsquo;s Pitt crew, then lost to Breast and Thighs in quarters. It was windier that Saturday and we struggled against their zone. After being knocked out, we played an extra game against Canada&rsquo;s U23 team. They went up 4-1, but we came back to win 11-9. I hit my head on the ground on a layout D early in the game and sat out the rest of it.</p>

<p>Overall, a great weekend.</p>

<p>Then BenJ and I ran a modified version of the shuffle ladder workout. We ran 4x6x25m shuffles with timed rest (2x,3x,3x,2x the time it took). Apparently this is how the workout is supposed to be done, so what I did last time is not quite right. After the sprints, Weeks, Garret and Jack joined us for burpees (200 total: 50 for me weeks and garret, 30 for ben, 20 for jack). Then we chilled, played some cups and went home.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played a one-day round-robin in Baltimore. I had two turns (both high-release backhands) and two or three Ds. I didn&rsquo;t play much because I&rsquo;m still trying to rest my shoulder. As a team, we played pretty well against weaker teams and not very well against AG. We struggled to move the disc to the break side (something we&rsquo;ve been focusing on a lot this season) and we didn&rsquo;t do a good job taking away their deep shots (we emphasized this before the game started). We gave up fewer deep goals in the second half, but only broke them once, which wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve been noticing lately is how really good teams are very efficient on offense. They often score in just a few throws, especially against weaker opponents. But with AMP, even when playing a worse team, we rarely score quickly. Everyone is open, but we get a lot of short-gain in-cuts. Maybe this happens because we&rsquo;ve been emphasizing moving the disc laterally, or maybe we just don&rsquo;t look for the deep shots as much. But something just doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>

    <p>Played one of the most ridiculous tournaments ever. Most of the teams we played were pretty weak, but our last game on Saturday was against a bunch of GOAT players and some strong women. They didn&rsquo;t play the best defense, but when you&rsquo;re scoring every point on O in about 6 or 7 throws, you don&rsquo;t have to. Besides that game, we won the rest easily.</p>

<p>I also played in the showcase game, which was North America vs The World. We had two girls from Sweden, a guy from NZ, two guys from Australia, an Asian girl, a Russian guy (Toli) and a few others. I don&rsquo;t remember who won because the score wasn&rsquo;t very important, but I&rsquo;d say we won in terms of silly and showoffy play. One point, I caught a high layout D on the first throw that was almost a Callahan, then turned and threw a Rochester for a goal. Definitely a highlight of my ultimate career.</p>

    <p>Played a good summer league game. We worked on dumps and stack spacing. Our offense started out pretty poorly and we were down 8-2 at half. But we came out of half strong and tied the game at 9s. After that we traded points the rest of the way, always down 1. Facing a hard cap at 17, we got the break to go up 16-15. They scored, bringing it to universe. We played patiently, but then turned it. They worked it up to the endzone and called a timeout, but could not convert. We worked it back the other way and punched it in.</p>

<p>After the game, we did 8 shuffle-into-sprints. 5 were same direction shuffling, the last 3 were opposite-direction shuffling. After that I did 20 burpees, then 14 more with Jill and Nasc.</p>
