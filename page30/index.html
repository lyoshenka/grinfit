  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played a one-day round-robin in Baltimore. I had two turns (both high-release backhands) and two or three Ds. I didn&rsquo;t play much because I&rsquo;m still trying to rest my shoulder. As a team, we played pretty well against weaker teams and not very well against AG. We struggled to move the disc to the break side (something we&rsquo;ve been focusing on a lot this season) and we didn&rsquo;t do a good job taking away their deep shots (we emphasized this before the game started). We gave up fewer deep goals in the second half, but only broke them once, which wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve been noticing lately is how really good teams are very efficient on offense. They often score in just a few throws, especially against weaker opponents. But with AMP, even when playing a worse team, we rarely score quickly. Everyone is open, but we get a lot of short-gain in-cuts. Maybe this happens because we&rsquo;ve been emphasizing moving the disc laterally, or maybe we just don&rsquo;t look for the deep shots as much. But something just doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>

    <p>Played one of the most ridiculous tournaments ever. Most of the teams we played were pretty weak, but our last game on Saturday was against a bunch of GOAT players and some strong women. They didn&rsquo;t play the best defense, but when you&rsquo;re scoring every point on O in about 6 or 7 throws, you don&rsquo;t have to. Besides that game, we won the rest easily.</p>

<p>I also played in the showcase game, which was North America vs The World. We had two girls from Sweden, a guy from NZ, two guys from Australia, an Asian girl, a Russian guy (Toli) and a few others. I don&rsquo;t remember who won because the score wasn&rsquo;t very important, but I&rsquo;d say we won in terms of silly and showoffy play. One point, I caught a high layout D on the first throw that was almost a Callahan, then turned and threw a Rochester for a goal. Definitely a highlight of my ultimate career.</p>

    <p>Played a good summer league game. We worked on dumps and stack spacing. Our offense started out pretty poorly and we were down 8-2 at half. But we came out of half strong and tied the game at 9s. After that we traded points the rest of the way, always down 1. Facing a hard cap at 17, we got the break to go up 16-15. They scored, bringing it to universe. We played patiently, but then turned it. They worked it up to the endzone and called a timeout, but could not convert. We worked it back the other way and punched it in.</p>

<p>After the game, we did 8 shuffle-into-sprints. 5 were same direction shuffling, the last 3 were opposite-direction shuffling. After that I did 20 burpees, then 14 more with Jill and Nasc.</p>

Our handling was pretty solid, our girls were better than theirs and everyone got a taste of zone. I&rsquo;m looking forward to this season.</p>

    <p>Played 7 games at Bellcrack - 4 on Saturday and 3 today. I did not play well in the first game on Sat. Lots of turns. But after that, I played well. Not a lot of Ds, but I also didn&rsquo;t play that many points. I think I accomplished most of the goals we set out - attacking the breakside, moving the disc horizontally, dictating and playing back-hip defense, being aggressive, taking appropriate risks. I got the pLei of the game on Saturday and then again in our last game on Sunday. I also threw Diana a fun goal. Life buddy win.</p>

<p>Lessons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue to focus on eliminating same-third throws.</li>
<li>Set up in cuts by going deep first.</li>
<li>Horizontal movement must lead to vertical movement.</li>
</ul>


<p>Improvement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put more touch on my IO flick.</li>
<li>Better awareness of other cutters around me.</li>
<li>S cut is the best cut.</li>

    <p>We won the finals of indoor spring league 36-34. That score is pretty deceptive though. In the first half, we opened up a huge lead. I think we were up by more than 10 points at one time. Then in the third quarter, we stopped playing <em>nice and easy</em> and they started scoring 2 for every 1 we put in. In the fourth, they went on a run, scoring 4 or 5 breaks in a row to bring the score within three. We called a timeout, regrouped, and got back to the nice and easy mentality. We held our lead to close out the game.</p>

    <p>A day full of ultimate. In the morning, Justin and I played a hat tourney at Edgely. Team &ldquo;Favorite Nonalcoholic Beverage&rdquo; played three games. The first two were close but not that serious (we won the first, lost the second). The last game was against Dre and Billy&rsquo;s team, which got me really fired up to win. We didn&rsquo;t play well at first, but went on a strong 5-point run to take half. We held our lead through the second half (though they narrowed the gap) but gave up two breaks on universe point to lose the game. Most of our team was pretty young, but we also had a few more experienced players. It was a great mix and we had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>After the games, Justin, Maddie and I hit up Chipotle and then swung by Sedgely for a bit of disc golf. We met Panna and Billy at hole 3 and played till the 9th hole. Then Anna picked me up and we headed off to indoor spring league.</p>

<p>We had a double header against Dre&rsquo;s team and then Butter&rsquo;s team. The first game was close for the whole game, but in the 4th quarter we made a concerted effort to move the disc quickly and not try to huck it, which helped us score a few quick breaks in a row and win the game 37-31. The second game was tougher, with us trailing by 1 for most of the game. We took the lead sometimes, but we were pretty tired and didn&rsquo;t have enough discipline to pull out the win. They won 31-30, handing us our first loss of the season.</p>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m really sore.</p>

    <p>Last AMP workout of the preseason. We warmed up with some throws, then worked on defense. We did the hunger drill (focusing on boxing out) and then the defensive positioning drill (focusing on bodying up while remaining balanced). Then we moved on to a 3 on 3 flow drill, where two cutters and a thrower (plus defenders) had to complete three passes on a full field (focus on defending in space, disc movement, setting up continuation cuts). Finally, we played several 4 on 4 games on a full field (focus on disc movement, smart decisions). We finished with a bit of sprints and ab conditioning.</p>
