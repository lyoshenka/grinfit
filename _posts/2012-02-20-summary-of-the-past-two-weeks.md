# Summary of the past two weeks

Haven't posted in a while. Here's a summary:  

2/14 - WL Full loss to Butter's team. We each had 6 guys and we both played well. We were up most of the game but died at the end.  

2/17 - Air Force WOD. Did it in 11:50 with 65lb barbell.  

2/16 - WL Full loss to RABS. We once again had 6 guys. They had their full team. They crushed us.  

2/19 - WL Core win against Alex Peters (27-21)
