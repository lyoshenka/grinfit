title: Half an Indoor Game
---

Brought Zoya to her first ultimate game. Found some parents on the sideline who agreed to watch her while I played. She was great - no more
stranger danger, all smiles and giggles. Our team crushed the other team, who was on the second game of their double-header and didn't have
many subs. Afterwards, we went out to lunch.
