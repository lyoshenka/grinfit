Played 2 pretty crappy games in the hat tournament, then a decent current vs alum game (we won 15-6 I think), and then a really fun old-alums vs young-alums game (we won that 7-4). The last game was the most competitive and interesting. I'd love to do that again next year.

I also finished 3rd overall in the skills competition and 2nd in longest pull.
