title: Crossfit Free Trial
---

Went to a free trial class at CrossFit New Haven. Class was not as intense as a real session, but a good intro. I pretty much intended to go there
already, so this was more like a sanity check to make sure they're not crazy (and get a free workout in).

AMRAP in 10 min of:

- 6 burpees
- 9 box jumps (18" box)
- 12 KB swings (12kg)

I did {% w 7 rounds %} plus 3 burpees.
