Played a close and intense summer league game against Norm's team. They have a good team - they were missing their best guy and girl and we still had a really hard time against them. Pretty much the whole game, we were within 1 or 2 points of each other. We got the first break, but they got it back a few points later. They took half 8-7 and we traded till 11-10 or so. Then we scored several breaks to bring it to 14-12, but they came back to 14s. Finally we closed the game out 15-14. 

We played the same way we usually play - slow in the first half, then better in the second half. We did switch to a backhand force for the second half and our girls bracketed and clogged the open side more too. If only we can come out strong in the first half, we'd have a much better record.

After the game, we had a great turnout at Edgely grilling. Both Pops and I had our birthdays today, and playing Norm made it even better. A lot of people from both teams came out, plus a few other teams joined our party too. There were sausages, chicken, cheesecake, pie, and plenty of beer. We didn't get home till after midnight.
