Last regular-season game, and it's against the 1 seed. They didn't play like they're the best team in the league, but they did beat us by 10 or so and they are solid all around. We played pretty well, and having Leo really helps. He's a great thrower and he knows when to cut deep. If only we'd had Tom, Ashley and Ashley, we could have had a really close game.
