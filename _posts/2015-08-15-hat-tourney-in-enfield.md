title: Hat Tourney in Enfield
---

Signed up last-minute for a hat tournament in Enfield (just north of Hartford). Ended up on Barb and Timmer's team. We started off weak, getting crushed in our first game. But then we dug in and won the next two pool games and three straight semis games to win the tourney. The final was us vs. the team we lost to first game. We were really tired (the day was HOT) and had lost some players to injury and concerts, so we picked up a few replacements. They also lost their best player, but picked up quality replacements as well. Victory was sweet, esp because we got a round of free wings for winning. I also met a bunch of cool CT ultimate players.
