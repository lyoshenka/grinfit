In some ways the worst Wildwood yet. Cops were super annoying, got a $333 ticket for open display of alcohol. Played quite poorly most of the time.
Shrooms didn't do much. Diana wasn't there.

In another sense, tourney was pretty good. Weather was great - not scorching hot, not pouring rain. Cline's dance party at Stardust was sick. Stayed up
till 4am both nights, got quite drunk but wasn't hung over. Partied with lots of people I like. Played well against Rabs and Humiliswag. Saved a bunch of 
money by sleeping in my car (the ppl whose house I slept in front of were not too happy). Chilled with Jennie, Barb, Robb and Max a good amount.
