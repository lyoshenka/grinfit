title: "Indoor Nationals"

Played two days of indoor at the Indoor Nationals. The whole thing was not very well organized and the fields were crappy (they were square) but it was still fun to play. We played well on Saturday but lost by 1 to a not-very-strong team. We still ended up winning our pool on point diff. Sunday, we beat Boston (the eventual winner) and made it as far as semis, but then lost in the semis to a team from DC. Our defense was good throughout the weekend, but our offense was disorganized at times and gave up too many turns. I'm not really sure what the cause was - square fields, lack of playing together, strong opponents? Either way, there's more to work on for the future.

After playing 4 games on Sat and 4 on Sunday, I went to our first indoor spring league games Sunday night. We won both and played pretty well, but again took too many ill-advised throws on offense. But I'm excited for spring league. Our team is fun and solid, and the seasson (which is 1/3rd over) promises to be a fun one.
