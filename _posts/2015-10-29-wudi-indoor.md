Another strong finish by the Rockford Peaches in fall league, though we played quite poorly in our second game. The guys didn't have many
subs, so our rotation was pretty tight. Our decision-making got really bad in the second game, especially towards the end. There was a
10-minute stretch right out of half where neither team scored a goal. We even called a timeout to talk about reining in our throws and going
for the easy ones, but then kept making bad choices even after that. In the end, we did manage to turn down the aggresiveness and score some
easy, patient goals. It also helped that the other team was missing Bosco, their best player.

Since Halloween is on Saturday, we all dressed up as the Peaches - pink dresses, red socks and hats. Our team was the best-dressed of the
evening.
