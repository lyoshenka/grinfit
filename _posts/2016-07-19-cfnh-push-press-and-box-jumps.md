title: 'CFNH: Push Press and Box Jumps'
---

## Strength

15 minutes of Push Press. Work up to a heavy triple.

I maxed out at {% w 3@145lb %}. I got 2@155lb on the following set but missed the 3rd rep :-(

## Skill

6min EMOM: 6 Box Jumps at a challenging height.

I started at 30in but bumped up to {% w 33in %} after the second set. I was finishing all 6 in about 20 seconds each time.

## WOD 1

3min AMRAP:

- 1 Push Press @ 55% of max weight from part 1
- 1 Box Jump @ 30in
- 2 Push Presses
- 2 Box Jumps
- etc

I got through exactly {% 7 rounds %} in 3min.

After a 3min rest, we did...

## WOD 2

Same as WOD 1, but in reverse. Start where you finished the first WOD (that's 7 reps of each for me) and work your way down. The goal is to
finish everything from WOD 1 in 3 minutes.

I managed to do this WOD even faster than the first one. Finished in {% w 2:50 %}, 10 seconds to spare.

This was a fun workout.
