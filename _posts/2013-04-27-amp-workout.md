Last AMP workout of the preseason. We warmed up with some throws, then worked on defense. We did the hunger drill (focusing on boxing out) and then the defensive positioning drill (focusing on bodying up while remaining balanced). Then we moved on to a 3 on 3 flow drill, where two cutters and a thrower (plus defenders) had to complete three passes on a full field (focus on defending in space, disc movement, setting up continuation cuts). Finally, we played several 4 on 4 games on a full field (focus on disc movement, smart decisions). We finished with a bit of sprints and ab conditioning.
