Pretty easy summer league game. It was quite windy and they had a lot of trouble with our zone. I spent most of thet time covering and being
covered by Brendan, a captain of Colt. He did a good job making me work hard to get open, which is exactly the kind of thing that's usually
missing in summer league. Glad I came to this game.
