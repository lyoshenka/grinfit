title: Coaching Sneetches, Ultisquash
---

Sara got a few AMPers to come to Haverford and help coach the Sneetches. We worked on upline dump defense and then pulling. I brought Diana's iPad and the
Ubersense app, which was really helpful in showing the girls where they were missing out on extra torque on their pulls.

After practice, we went over to the squash courts and played over an hour of ultisquash. It was good to get back into the game. We had a wide range of
talent, from people who've played a lot to people who've only played once or twice. The games were pretty fun, but with lots of turns. I need to figure out
how to minimize my turns and throw more effectively.
