title: Spinners Practice
---

Went to a Spinners practice. We started with a few force-middle dump drills, then spent the rest of practice scrimmageing. We played a 3-team game to 7 (final scores: 7-6-6) and then worked on breaking up the pull play and double-team sideline traps. Overall, very beneficial.
