title: Pullups, Paleo
---

Started the "Master the Pullup" plan on [Lift](https://lift.do). I skipped the first week, so today's workout was:

- 6 Pull-Up
- 5 Chin-Up
- 4 Neutral Pull-Up
- 6 Chin-Up
- 5 Pull-Up

90 seconds rest between sets

Diana and I also started a Paleo diet for the next 4 weeks as part of Lift's Quatified Diet experiment. Each person gets randomly assigned to one of 10 diets, and they track how you do (how you feel, your weight, etc). Paleo was one of the more restrictive diets, and also one of the most different from my normal diet. So this should be fun.
