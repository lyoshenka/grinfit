## Strength/Skill Work

- Heaving Snatch Balance (3x5 Rest 1:00). Add weight as form & mobility allow.
- Turkish Get Up (3x3 per arm, Rest 1:00)

I worked up to {% w 70lb %} on the snatch balance and {% w 30lb %} on the getups.

## WOD 

15:00 AMRAP

Starts with 1000m Row Buy In

Then with time remaining:

Start with X=1 and increase X by 1 each round

- X DB Snatches per arm
- X DB Lunge Steps per leg
- X Burpees

Got {% w 6 %} rounds + {% w 9 %} DB snatches (5 left arm, 4 right arm). Used a {% w 30lb %} dumbbell. Switched to goblet squats instead of lunges halfway through because my tendonitis was bothering me.
