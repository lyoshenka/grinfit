Ben Johnson is organizing a group workout session for the spinners guy.
Today was day 1. We focused on a few simple things, then did testing.
Here's the workout: foam rolling, dynamic warmup, ohs/reach tests, med ball
throws that simulate a broad jump, box jumps, wide arm plank, 10m sprints,
max rep push-ups, max rep pullups, active plank, 2x sled push relay. I
don't remember all my stats, but I did 40 push-ups, 13 pullups, and 1:39
plank. My sprints were the slowest of the team. I did OK in sled push.
