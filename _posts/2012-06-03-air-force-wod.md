Using a 65lb bar, for time:

- 20 Thrusters
- 20 Sumo Deadlift High Pulls
- 20 Push Press
- 20 Front Squat
- 20 Back Squat

Every minute, on the minute, stop where you are and do 4 burpees. Then continue where you left off.

My time: 9:45. Beat my previous time by 2 minutes. Gonna have to bump up the weight soon.
