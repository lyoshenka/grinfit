4 hours of practice. High heat, low numbers. We practiced moving the disc to the breakside by punishing 4 consequetive throws on the open
side with a turnover. Our offense looked significantly better with this one minor, forced tweak. However, I did not play well. I had several 
bad turns and got quite tired. On the last points, my quad crampted up and I dropped out.
