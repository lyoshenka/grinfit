title: 2 Hours Of Mini
---

Played 2 hours of mini at the Yale IM fields. I felt very out of shape, most likely because I spent all winter lifting heavy and not running
at all. Chasing Ross and Bosco around for 2 hours killed me. Really looking forward to switching to Crossfit/shuttles for the next few
months.
