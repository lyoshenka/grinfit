90 min of goalty at Miriam's going-away party. We played double-goal goalty for the first time. It was fun, though I prefer single-goal
because its encourages better defense. With two goals, you expect to get scored on so you hang back to protect against the fast break on the
way back. So you don't always sprint to get back and protect your goal. Besides that, it was a great time.
