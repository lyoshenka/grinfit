Played a short game in the rain. Edgely was swamped so we moved to the Belmont Plateau fields. Ended up only playing to 9 because it got dark. It was very rainy and wet, so throwing and catching was tough for everyone. Gloves would definitely have helped, especially because our deep game was lacking. I threw several good backhand hucks but every flick huck attempt slipped out of my hand and fluttered to the ground. The game was close the whole way through, but Ditz's team scored a late break to go up 8-7 and "take half", so they received again and scored that to win 9-7.

Afterwards Vinny, Jean and I ran some shuffle-sprints. We did 8 total: 4 normal ones and 4 out-in-alltheway. We drank beer and ate carnitas and stayed up till 3am.
