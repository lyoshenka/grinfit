title: Nationals 2015

3 days of ultimate with Metro North. Played 7 games total. Didn't play that great overall, but improved throughout the weekend. Best game was the last game against Wildcard. 

In general, my main places to improve are fitness (as always), throwing, and switching my mindset from D to O. My biggest issue was too many bad throwing decisions after getting a turn. I play much better when I look for breaks and move the disc quickly, not try to huck it. I don't think I completed any hucks at all this weekend.

Btw, we finished 7th at nationals and qualified for the Pro Flight for next year.

*I believe that love will find a way.*
