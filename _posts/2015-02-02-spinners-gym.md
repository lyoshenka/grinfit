Back from Iceland and from my 2-week ultimate hiatus. Knee felt pretty good at the gym, no pain or soreness. I still skipped the one-legged squats on that
side, but did everything else.

Because of the snow day last week, we're back on day 1 today. Here are my numbers:

- Deadlift: {% w 5@225,275,295lb %}
- KB Press: {% w 8@35lb, 10@35lb, 10@30lb %}

- DB Snatch: {% w 3x5@45lb %}
- TRX Row: {% w 2x12,1x10 %}
- RFESS: {% w 3x5@100lb %} (right leg only)
- Valslide Bodysaw: {% w 3x12 %}

At the end, did relay sled sprints and SEAL pushups. For the sled, we had 5 people per team, and each person did 6 sprints with 225lb on the sled. Doing
them back to back like that is a lot harder. I definitely felt tired and winded when we finished. For SEAL pushups, each team got in a line, got into
pushup position, then put our feet on the shoulders of the person behind us. The groups faced each other and we did pushups on command, holding at the top
between reps. I think we did about 10-15 pushups.
