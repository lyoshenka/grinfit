Ran an abbreviated stairs workout. Apparently I pulled my quad for real on Saturday and it's not ready for real work yet. Here's what I got through:

- Every other
- Two up, one down
- Every other
- Kareoke
- Every other
- Left foot only
- Every other
- Right foot only
- Every other all the way up

Rest

- Every other
- Rotators (hop every stair, rotating 90 degrees on each hop. change the direction you rotate at each landing)
- Every other
- Every step, 5 burpees at each landing (this was brutal)
- Every other
- Every step, 10 full-body crunches at each landing
- Every other
- Speed skaters
- Every other all the way up

Rest

The crew did Kleavelands here, but I decided to stop running so I did some pushups and sit-ups. I took a dip in the fountain and we threw for about 15 min.
