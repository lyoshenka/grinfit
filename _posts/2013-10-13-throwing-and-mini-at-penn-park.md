title: Throwing and Mini at Penn Park

Had a short throwing and mini session at Penn Park. It was quite windy out, which is good prep for the supposedly-windy Frisco games. My wind throws definitely need improvement. On the plus side, Diana, Maddie and I won all our mini games. Brunch was crepes at Houston Hall.
