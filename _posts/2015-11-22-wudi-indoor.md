Started our first game with only 3 people. Had to pick up some friends for
the first half, until reinforcements arrived. Ended up losing by a couple.
Second game was closer and more intense. We won in OT after they had the
disc to win bun turned it over.

In general, I thought we played pretty poorly (probably not a popular
sentiment). Lots of high risk throws and turnovers. Some of the risky stuff
worked (Including the winning throw of the last game), but it's not a
sustainable way of playing.
