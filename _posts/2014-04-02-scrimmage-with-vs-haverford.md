A few AMP guys and friends of the team scrimmaged the Haverford mens' team. We played a game to 6 first (which we won 6-2), then played about 6 or 7 points of zone against them to give them more practice. Finally, we mixed up the teams and scrimmaged for half an hour or so. We didn't have many subs, so I got to play a lot. Haverford has several players who are very strong, but they didn't move the disc too well and relied on being taller and more athletic.
