2 hours of goalty. My first time doing anything hard outside. Body did not like it.

My feet forgot how to wear cleats. I got a blister on one heel and will prolly lose a toenail. Sore all over. Got a bit sunburnt. So tired
after just a few hours.

Lifting is good and all, but its time for shuttles/shuffles.
