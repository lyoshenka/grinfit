An exciting weekend for Metro North. We won the region, beating Slow White (the top seed, and #2 in the country) 15-13 in the finals. That
game was one of the cleanest and most focused games I've ever played. Our O line only had two turns, and only let Slow convert one of them.
Our D line converted two breaks (I caught both of them :-) ), and had a chance to convert at least one more. I felt like I was completely
in the zone and focused on the game. I did talk to people on the sideline, but I barely remember what I said.

Before the finals, we had a few close games with 7X and Wildcard. I played fairly well in those too, though I had one or two turns on Sat
and missed some D opportunities.
