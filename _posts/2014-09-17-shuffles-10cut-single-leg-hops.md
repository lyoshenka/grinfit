title: Shuffles, 10cut, Single-Leg Hops
---

Gorgeous day outside. Snuck in a quick workout with Diana at the highrises:

- 2x5x single-leg lateral hops. Focus on sticking the landing.
- 2x5x shuffle-and-hops. Same as single-leg hops, but take one shuffle-step, then hop.
- Several starts with feet parallel, then with facing 90 degrees to a side.
- 6x10secs 5yd shuffle, 30secs between reps.
- 3x10cut drill, 90secs between reps.
- 5 min tired throwing. Ended with 10 crisp backhands, 10 crisp flicks, 5 hammers.
