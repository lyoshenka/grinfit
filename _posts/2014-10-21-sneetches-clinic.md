Came out to Haverford to help coach the Sneetches for a day. We did the Gauntlet drill in slow motion, focusing on body positioning and footwork. Then we
ran it faster to simulate more game-realistic moves. After that we did the hunger drill with no jumping, focusing once more on body positioning, as well as
reading the disc and catching with the opposite hand. Finally, we played 4-on-4 winter-league style until it got dark.

When I say we, I really mean the womenâ€™s team. I mostly coached, watched and gave feedback. I did get some throws in during the hunger drill, and also at
the end with Stu.
