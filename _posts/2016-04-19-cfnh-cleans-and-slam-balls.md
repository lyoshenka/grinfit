title: 'CFNH: Cleans and Slam Balls'
---

## Strength

4 rounds of:

- 5 Hang Cleans
- 10 [Hollow/Arch Rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6VUh9ig4ZU)

I did a warmup set of cleans at 115lb, then hit {% w 135.135,145,155lb %}

## WOD

3 rounds of:

- 5 Power Cleans, 5 Slam Balls
- 4 Power Cleans, 5 Slam Balls
- 3 Power Cleans, 5 Slam Balls
- 2 Power Cleans, 5 Slam Balls
- 1 Power Cleans, 5 Slam Balls

2min rest between rounds. 2min time cap on each round.

Score = total work time (max: 6 min) + 1 second for each unfinished rep.

I started the workout with a {% w 135lb %} bar and a {% w 30lb %} ball, but dropped to {% w 115lb %} after the first round. Even then, I
didn't finish a single round. I got through 3 sets the first time, 3 sets + 2 reps the second, and back to 3 sets the third, for a total of
{% w 6:37 %} for my score.
