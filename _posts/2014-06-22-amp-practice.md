We worked on deep throws and defense in the air, then switched to 5v5 and 6v6 scrimmage, then worked on zone (ATC and 1-3-3). All the drills felt very productive and I liked the pace. We went hard up front in the deep drills, running a good amount of sprints with little rest. Then in the scrimmages, we had enough subs to wholesale every point, so we got a good amount of rest. I felt like I was pretty much fully rested for each point. The zone work and scrimmages were pretty good, though with no wind, it tough to replicate zone conditions. I gave into throwing loopy over-the-top throws a few times even though I would not throw them in a real zone game. Still, it was good to go through the reps. We even played with an extra defender and the O still managed to score a decent number of times. 

After watching the videos ([1](https://vimeo.com/98890149),[2](https://vimeo.com/98997131)) from the 5on5 scrimmage, it's very clear how effective it is to make big deep cuts. Many of them either turned into goals, or became big in cuts. The big unders may be partially because of our emphasis on playing back-hip defense. I'm curious to see how this works against teams that play underneath defense. Hopefully our throwers can punish them with deep shots.

After practice, we hit up Dre's uncle's pool for some swimming and burgers. Then I took a short nap and continued the party at Sara's: DIY pizza and the USvPortugal world cup game.
