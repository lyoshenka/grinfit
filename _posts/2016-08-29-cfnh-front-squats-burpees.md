## Strength/Skill Work

4 rounds of:

- 4x5 Front Squats, building: {% w 125,135,155,165lb %}
- 4x8 Reverse V-Ups (leg sliders)

## WOD

For time, with an 8min cap:

- 21 Burpee Plate Jumps
- 21 Front Squats
- 15 Burpee Plate Jumps
- 15 Front Squats
- 9 Burpee Plate Jumps
- 9 Front Squats

The RX weight is 95lb. I started off with 85lb, but dropped down to {% w 75lb %} about 3 squats in. Even with that, I was 4 squats short of
finishing in the 8min cap. I attribute this to some combination of going hard in the first half of the workout, and not eating that well the
last few days.
