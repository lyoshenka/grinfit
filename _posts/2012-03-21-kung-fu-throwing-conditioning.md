title: Kung Fu Throwing + Conditioning
---

Spinners track workout at Temple. I still can't run, so Glazer and I did Parts 1 and 2 of Kung Fu Throwing. I liked part 1 but thought that part 2 was too short. That's the part that I need the most work on, but it has very few throws. I think I'd double or triple that part next time. Then we did the typical Spinners conditioning (push ups, squats, abs).
