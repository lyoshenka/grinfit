title: AMP Practice
---

Amp practice 9am-1pm. I rolled my ankle at about 9:30, so I spent most of the time watching and icing. It was a good practice. We worked on proper swing/continue cutting and applied that in redzone offense. This is one of my weak points so I wish I hadn't hurt myself because I needed the reps. Hopefully I'll be ready by Wednesday.

Did 50 AMPs throughout the day and then 20 more with everyone at the end.
