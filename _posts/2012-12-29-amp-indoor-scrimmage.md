title: "AMP Indoor Scrimmage"
---

Played 3 hours of indoor at Tee's. We didn't take many breaks and played pretty hard. By the end, I was pretty beat. I played about the same way I always play: good on D and receiving, too many throwaways (some stupid decisions, some just bad throws). I always forget that hammers are a good throw indoors.
