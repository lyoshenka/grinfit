Played 7 games at Bellcrack - 4 on Saturday and 3 today. I did not play well in the first game on Sat. Lots of turns. But after that, I played well. Not a lot of Ds, but I also didn't play that many points. I think I accomplished most of the goals we set out - attacking the breakside, moving the disc horizontally, dictating and playing back-hip defense, being aggressive, taking appropriate risks. I got the pLei of the game on Saturday and then again in our last game on Sunday. I also threw Diana a fun goal. Life buddy win.

Lessons:

- Continue to focus on eliminating same-third throws.
- Set up in cuts by going deep first.
- Horizontal movement must lead to vertical movement.

Improvement:

- Put more touch on my IO flick.
- Better awareness of other cutters around me.
- S cut is the best cut.
