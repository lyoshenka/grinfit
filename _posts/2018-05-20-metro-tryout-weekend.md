title: Metro Tryout Weekend
---

Two days of 4-hour tryouts. The plan for each day was lots of scrimmaging, a few drills, and a bit of conditioning at the end. I felt pretty
good, though could have been in better shape. My pulls were kinda weak, but I did take some time to work on my flicks. I also did pretty
well in the conditioning, but I think I def need to work on fitness. Lifting is good, but I gotta get shuttles/shuffles in, and more metcon
work as well.
