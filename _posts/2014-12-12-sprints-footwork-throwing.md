Did some agility, sprinting and throwing with Gabe in the Penn bubble.

## Agility

- Ladder warmup - about 10-12 passes through the ladder with various steps
- Abduction and adduction hops, and related ladder exercise

## Sprints

- 6x100yd sprints every minute on the minute. Ended up being about 40 seconds rest between sprints.
- 4x10sec shuffles, 20secs between each set

## Throwing

Threw 25 flicks, 25 backhands and 10 hammers at each of 10, 20 and 30 yards apart. Finished with 10 lefties at close range and 50 seconds of plank (10 for
each drop).
