title: Boston Mixed Mixer Hat Tourney
---

Played a fun hat tournament run by Slow White. It was great to play with some people that I only get to play against (Miller, Ralph, Davis,
etc). The level of play was reasonaly high, but there were some newer players (league and college players), so it was more fun than intense.
Still, it was a great workout. I got to handle a good amount and cover some great players. Plus our team won the whole thing and got a
last-round bye. What more could you ask for?
