title: Pullups and Squats
---

## Strength / Skill Work

- 3x16 Suitcase Walking Lunge Step @ {% w 35,40,45lb %}
- Butterfly Pullup work. I'm basically there, just need to get the tempo and leg movement down so I can do them repeatedly without swinging
  wildly.


## WOD

4 Rounds For Time (17min Cap)

- 20 Pullups
- 20 Goblet Squats @ {% w 30lb %}
- 10cal Assault Bike (subbed for 40 double-unders)

I did kipping pullups for the first two rounds, but completely tore up my hands in the process. So I switched to SVPUs for the last two
rounds. I finished the workout in {% w 13:59 %}


## Gymnastics

- 3x8 Supine-grip Ring Rows: Slow pull (no snaking or jerking) with a 2 second hold at the top. Rest 60 seconds between sets.
- 5x60sec Bottom-of-Squat Hold: Rest as long as you were able to hold. Fight for upright torso position.
- 5x Chin-over-bar Hold for max time: Stay hollow at the top, use a band only if absolutely necessary. Rest as needed between efforts.
- 4x10 per side One-Legged Box Squats: No rest, just switch sides.
- 4x30-60sec Plank on Elbows

The gymnastics work was pretty brutal today because it was almost exactly the same thing we did during the WOD. I couldn't even do the
chin-over-bar hangs because my hands were dead. The ring rows were really hard as well. The rest of the workout was decent. I killed squat
holds and did fairly well on box squats (though I didn't know the focus was on going slow and balancing). I hit 45sec on each plank.
