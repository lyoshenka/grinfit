title: "Penn Park Workout"

Had a solid workout at Penn Park. We opened with burpee broad jumps, then moved on to several lateral cutting drills. First was a simple lateral shuffle drill, switching sides on command. Next, we did a the short-cut-long-cut drill where defense reacts to the offense. Finally, we did the O-vs-D cutting in a box drill. After the lateral movements, we finished with several sprints of increasing length.

After the workout, we had an AMP dinner and leadership meeting at City Tap.
