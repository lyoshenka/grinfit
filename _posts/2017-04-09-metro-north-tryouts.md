title: Metro North Tryouts
---

Went to the first weekend of Metro tryouts. I didn't play much, because I'm still rehabbing my knee. But I did warmups, participated in a
few drills, and spent a lot of time stretching and slow-squatting. I also helped out where I could, collecting discs and dispensing advice.
Tryouts went well - there are some promising new players, old vets, and friends who I haven't played with in a while. Best of all, my knee
feels pretty good. I didn't do much, but its the first workout I've done in a while that didn't leave my tendon sore.

On the downside, I'm months behind in fitness. I'll have to work hard over the next few months to catch up, but be careful not to overdo it.
I'm really looking forward to having a squat rack in my basement.
