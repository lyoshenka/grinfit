Ladder warmup, then {% w 5x150yd shuttles %} on a 25yd course. Rest 2m between reps.

Hit about 31 seconds on each. The course was a bit longer, but now I picked out some landmarks to make it consistent: from the second crack in the
wall to the second hole past the stairs. The longer rests helped me feel less awful.
