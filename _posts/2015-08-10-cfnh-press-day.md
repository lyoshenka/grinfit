## Strength/Skill Work

4 rounds of:

- 6 Shoulder Press, building up to 70% 1RM
- Ring Push Ups

65lb press, 5 pushups per round

## WOD

15:00 AMRAP

- 10 Push Press (from floor)
- 10 Box Jumps (24in box)
- 10 Push Ups
- Run: 50m * # of rounds (so 50m first round, 100m second round, etc)

Got through exactly 5 rounds, using 75lb for the push press. I picked up the bar for the 6th round, but didn't get any reps in.
