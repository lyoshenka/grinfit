A list of one-or-two-sentence summaries from some recent [S&CR.com](http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com) posts:

Adding a back-off set at 50% of 1RM following a workout involving a strength protocol at high percentages of 1RM (e.g. 85 â€“ 90%) may increase strength and size gains without compromising gains in power. ([Are back-off sets useful after a strength workout?](http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/2013/02/18/back-off-sets/))

Since power is at greater risk of the detraining effect than maximum strength, athletes whose sports require powerful movements should take care to avoid long periods of time spent without training. ([How is detraining different from tapering?](http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/2013/02/04/tapering/))

A general, aerobic warm-up or a general aerobic warm-up followed by dynamic stretching are the best types of warm-ups for optimizing countermovement jump performance. Static stretching leads to reductions in performance, irrespective of where it is placed in the warm-up. ([How do the different elements of a warm-up affect jump performance?](http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/2013/02/27/practical-training-tips-february/))
