A hot windy day with not many subs. We did the usual drills, scenarios, and
scrimmages. I played more than I wanted to, but my knee still feels pretty
good. It's in the maybe-sore-maybe-ok phase where I'm not sure if it's
gonna hurt later, or if it's fine. One thing I did notice is that
stretching makes a big difference. I didn't stretch the last two days, and
I felt tight getting out of bed. I'm gonna redouble my efforts to stretch
every day.
