## Part 2 - Plyos

- Pair up. 3 rouds of: 10 medball throws straight up for height with a 15lb medball (alternate with your partner), 10 sideways hurdle jumps over your partner.
- 10 reps of: sprint 15, jump as high as you can when you hit the 15yd line. We did the first few to the line and the rest to a cue (either a whistle or when we saw a stationary person jump).

## Part 3 - Hunger Drill

It was pretty windy but we got in some solid throwing and cutting. It was really hard to read, so I focused on getting in front of the other player and boxing out hard, even if I ended up misreading the disc somewhat.
