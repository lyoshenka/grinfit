## Skills/Strength

5 rounds of:

- 7 Deadlift @ 60% 1RM
- 14 Russian Twist with 2sec pause on each side

Based on my last deadlift set (5@295), I estimated my 1RM at 345lb. So I went with {% w 205lb %} for the deadlifts. It was fairly heavy but 
I don't think I struggled on any rep. I used {% w 10lb %} for the twists - definitely too light.

## WOD

For time:

- 10 Hang Power Cleans, 100 Jump rope singles
- 8 Hang Power Cleans, 80 Jump rope singles
- 6 Hang Power Cleans, 60 Jump rope singles
- 4 Hang Power Cleans, 40 Jump rope singles
- 2 Hang Power Cleans, 20 Jump rope singles

I used {% w 105lb %} for the cleans and finished in {% w 7:03 %}.
