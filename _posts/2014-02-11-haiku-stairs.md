Hiked the beautiful, dangerous and slightly illegal [Haiku Stairs](http://unrealhawaii.com/2010/05/haiku-stairs/). That's 4000 steps and 2000ft to the top, plus sneaking through secret forest paths and hiding from the guards before you even get to the trail. It took us about two hours on the way up, an hour on the way down. Possibly the most scenic workout I've ever done.
