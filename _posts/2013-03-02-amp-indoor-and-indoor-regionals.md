First, played an hour of indoor with AMP. I tried out my abbreviated warmups and I think they went well. I just need to speak louder and demonstrate the new exercises up front. 

After that, we drove over to MapleZone and played in the first-ever Indoor Regionals. We won our first and third poold game easily but lost the second one to Tad's team. We still made semis though. In semis, we beat Scorpio (BLo's team and probably the favorite to win it). Then in the finals, we had a rematch against Tad's team and beat them by 2 points to win the whole thing. Tad's team ended up beating BLo in the backdoor finals to take the second bid to nationals.
