Picked up with Butter's core team for a game against Dallas. We went up early and didn't take it very seriously, but then they came back and won by 1 or 2. It was a very fun game even though we didn't win - very spirited and pretty high level. 

After that, we played our 3rd place game against Butter's full team. His full team was also missing a lot of players, so most of them were pickups and the whole game felt like a high-level pickup game (I spent a quarter playing tag with Marin instead of playing the game). We ended up winning by a lot.
