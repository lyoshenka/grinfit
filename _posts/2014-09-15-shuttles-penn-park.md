- 1x150yd (50yd course)
- 1x300yd (25yd course)
- 5x150yd (25yd course)

120 seconds rest between each, 4 minutes rest after the 300.

I threw between most of the shuttles. Then Diana and I went to Left Bank and threw medium-distance for 10 min or so. I worked on keeping my flicks high and flat, and throwing flicks after a backhand fake.
