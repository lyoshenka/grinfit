title: "ECC Seattle"
---

Played our last regular season tournament: ECC in Seattle. We finished 3rd and played pretty well most of the time, but had too many unforced turns in the semis against Wildcard. I made good progress on my defensive focus, especially in that game, but still had two poor throwing decisions and did not play at 100% on every single point. I'd give myself an 8 out of 10 for the weekend.

Stats for the weekend: 6 goals, 2 assists, 3 throwaways (though I consider one to be only 50% my fault), 3 Ds.

Most of the team stayed until Monday night and spent Monday hanging out in Seattle. I really liked the city. It's very green and close to nature. There's water everywhere. It really reminds me of Portland, Maine. I know I'm a bit biased because the weather was nice (not rainy like it often is) and I spent most of the day doing fun stuff. But still, I'd live there.
