title: Ben Wiggins AMA on Reddit
---

Haven't been doing much work lately (rehabbing my shoulder, plus lots of work at work), but I've been reading/watching/thinking about ultimate a lot. Here's a great [AMA from Ben Wiggins](http://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/zrt6u/i_am_ben_wiggins_3time_club_national_champion/). It's full of good advice and thoughts on the current state of ultimate and where it's headed. For example, here's an answer about handler training:

> Handler training: I am going to say this roughly 1 million times in my life, but it bears repeating...Throw Every Day. Steve Nash doesn't take days 
> off of shooting when he wants to improve. Tony Gwynn didn't have non-BP days. Heck, how many of the best Halo players ever miss a 24-hour period? If 
> you want to be better than last year, TED is your goal. In my best seasons, I missed 7 and 9 days of throwing in the 365 day span before Nationals.
>
> Beyond that: Play something. Ultimate is fine and all, but play hoops or mini or hockey or something to work on the reactions and confidence and communication 
> of sports without overusing the specific Ultimate parts of your body. This probably isn't very different than cutters. Many years, I would use low level 
> winter and spring games to work on cutter-type stuff because I wouldn't get many chances to practice it during the year. And because it was fun.

Here's some more advice on effective drilling:

> I think of continuation or flow as 'what you do while the disc is in the air between two of your teammates'.
>
> As a coach, it can be easy to focus on the whiteboard version of 'when disc moves like this, players should do this'. What we forget is that 
> each of those moves is an OODA loop (look this up, it is rad). Each player needs to observe the field, orient themselves to the situation, 
> decide if and where to move, and then act. To coach that, you shouldn't be working at the birds-eye angle...you need to drill for instinct. Break 
> it down. If you are here, and they disc moves there, you should turn your head to see this and take 2 steps this direction. Drill ONLY that piece 
> before you go on. Give players the little tools to do what they need to react and use that air time.
> 
> If you don't know these things...then as a coach, your first mission is fact finding and NOT coaching. If you can't break it down, then you don't 
> know it enough to teach it. Describe it? Sure. Teach it? Not yet.
>
> You can break these things down, though. Find out what YOU do when you are reacting correctly. Notice your feet, your head, the variables that you 
> use to decide. Then recreate those in drills.
