---

## Warmup

Tabata: alternating PVC pipe OHS and 12lb wallballs

## Skill Work

10min EMOM: 10x2 Snatch: {% w 65lb %}

Tried to go up in weight near the end, but dropped back to 65 after one set. My quads were still super sore from Monday.

## WOD

15:00 AMRAP

1600m Row Buy-in, then AMRAP

- 10 Power Snatch
- 10 Wallballs

I did {% w 55lb %} power snatch and {% w 20lb %} wallballs. Got through {% w 3+17 %} rounds+reps. Was very close to finishing the 4th round,
but was also dying.

Finished off the day with 3 very shitty muscleups.
