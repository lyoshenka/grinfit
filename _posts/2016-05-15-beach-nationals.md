Had a great time at Beach Nationals with Weekend with Bernie. Everyone on the team were Youngbloods players, except me and Max. The team was
a lot of fun, both on and off the field. We came in seeded 15th but finished 10th. Personally, I played really well on Saturday. I only had
two turns, both against Amp in our crossover game. One was a drop, one was a huck that went just a bit too far. Other than that, my throws
were on point and my D was very solid. The game against Amp was actually my best game, with lots of nice breaks and good cutting.

On Sunday, I played really bad. I threw a bunch of turns, was not focused on D, and was all around pretty meh. Maybe staying up all night
raging *doesn't* make you better at sports?
