After lot of team shifts and last-minute scrambling for players, we scraped together a squad to send to Clambake. I only knew half the team
going into the weekend, but they turned out to be a great bunch. We also had people drop and pick up as the tourney progressed. We ended up
winning all our pool games and making it all the way to semis before Silence of the Clams knocked us out. The weekend was cold and windy on
the whole, so a lot of games were upwind-downwind turnoverfests. Our "bobbing for shots" game went over really well during the day. The game
didnt make it to the party because we went hard pretty early and lost focus.
