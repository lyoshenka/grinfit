title: "Wednesday and Thursday: Winter League"

Won our core game on Wednesday, then tied BLo's full team on Thursday.

Core: going pretty well. We're getting chillier on O and we ran a zone on D that worked well at first.

Full: our O is still having problems. We threw into a lot of poaches and made dumb mistakes. We're also still taking too long to sub.&nbsp;
