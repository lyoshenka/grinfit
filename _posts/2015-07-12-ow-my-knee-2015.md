Two days of fun in the sun with the sharkfuckers. Played 7 games with a
combined point diff of 94-45. Wasn't too tired because we didn't have that
many points to play. I had some silly turns of Sat but tightened it up on
Sunday. The finals was my best game - no turns, at least 4 assists, a
handful of Ds, and a hand block followed by a Rochester for the goal. We
won $1000, threw it in the air, swam in it naked and swaggered around as
much as we could.
