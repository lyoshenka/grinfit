title: "A Bit of Throwing at Penn Park"
---

Biked to Penn Park and threw for a bit. I was there for about an hour and half the time was spent moving from field to field in search of unoccupied space. Between intramural sports and practicing teams, it wasn't easy but it was still good to go out and throw.
