Played Bill's Team (Rag Tag) in the semis. Lost by one point (just like the first time we played them) but the game went a bit differently. This time, we
were down most of the way and went on a 6-point run at the end to bring it within 1. We were missing Furf, Raha and Diana. The game was a lot of fun.
Butter instructed me to win with my legs, and I did that fairly well (perhaps too well - I didn't sub enough and got caught tired at moments). Ben's
fitness seems to have helped, but I stil had some bad throwaways. Billy and Sachie played especially well, and Truskin was unstoppable in the air. I threw
the last throw - a blade to Tom in the endzone - that Owen D'ed very nicely to prevent us from going into overtime.
