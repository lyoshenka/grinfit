title: More Ultisquash
---

Another 2 hours of ultisquash. Played with some of the greats in the game: Schmucker, TC, Wheels, Raha, Diana. We had some really heated and competitive games. I spent a bunch of time covering Schmucker and even got some Ds on him, so I think my game is improving. My throws still need work though. I need to do a search for how often I've used that phrase (or some variation of it) on this blog.

I ended the session pretty banged up: slightly rolled ankle, almost hyperextended my elbow, sore fingers and knees, etc. It's gonna be nice to take the next week of in Hawaii.
