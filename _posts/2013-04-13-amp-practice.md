title: AMP Practice
---

First AMP practice of the season. We worked on sideline situations: dumping, swinging and defending the dump. Then we played some full-field 3 on 3. At the end, some sprints and core fitness. After practice, spikeball and lunch at Llama Tooth (good food and beer, super slow).
