Did a short workout with Miggs, Panna, Butter, Papa, Slater, Dave and Himilaya. Part 1 was several drills where cutters made deep cuts for throwers. When you weren't cutting, you were sprinting a 40 to catch the disc. Part 2 was 5 reps of: sprint 40m, 30 seconds of Roman Chair (a wall sit where you are back to back with a partner). Part 3 was 10 minutes of longer throwing. 

Overall, a good workout. We worked on timing our cuts for the upline handler cut and on sprints with decent rest inbetween.
