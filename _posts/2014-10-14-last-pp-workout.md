title: Last PP Workout
---

I'd taken the whole week off before last practice, and took Monday off as well to make sure my knee was 100%. But I couldn't keep doing nothing, so I came
out for the last workout to do some shuttles, shuffles and throwing. We took forever finding a place to run because most fields were busy with intramurals
or other team practice. Eventually we ran 4 shuttles and 4 shuffles, then threw till the IM ultimate game kicked us off.
