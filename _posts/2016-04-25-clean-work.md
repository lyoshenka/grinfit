## Strength / Skill

Sets of:

- 1 Clean Pull
- 1 Hang Clean
- 1 Power Clean

I built up to {% w 155lb %} for the triple.

Form feedback: when I set up, keep my butt higher and my shoulders in front of the bar (lats over the bar). This will fix my problem of the
bar hitting my knees on the way up, and me having to pull back instead of up. I should also go a bit slower on the deadlift portion of the
clean.

## WOD

4 rounds for time:

- 15 KBS at {% w 70lb %}
- 30 total Russian Twists with a {% w 25lb %} plate
- 15 Box jumps on a {% w 24inch %} box

Rest 1:30 between each round.

My total work time was {% w 9:48 %}

Finished off with 4 muscle ups.
