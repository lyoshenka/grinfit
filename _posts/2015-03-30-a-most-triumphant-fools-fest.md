title: A Most Triumphant Fools Fest
---

Three days of ultimate, partying and foolishness. We played mostly ok, considering the shitty weather, non-seriousness, and future
water consumption. Our ladies (esp Sachie, Hanna, Raha) were consistently great. The rest of us had our moments of greatness and
bogusness, but overall it was a glorious time. We lost in the semis of the middle bracket, played 8 games on the weekend, and sang
"Everything is Drinking" at least 50 times. Max also got birthdayed at the sushi place and Markham won the party.
