## Strength / Skill Work

- 6,4,2,4,3 Back Squats (rest 1:30 after each set)
- 5x6 [Batwings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBsDSSHzeJA) (rest 1:30 after each set)

Squat weights:

- First set of 6 should be around 55% of 1RM
- 2nd set of 4 should be heavier than 1st set of 4
- Last set of 3 should be same, or more, than set of 2

My squats were {% w 6@125lb, 4@155lb, 2@205lb, 4@175lb, 3@205lb %}, and I used {% w 30lb %} DBs for the batwings.

The coaches told me that I tend to come up on my toes during the squat. I took my sneakers off and went barefoot for the last few sets,
which seems to have helped a good amount. The cues I need to focus on are squeezing my butt the whole time (starting at the bottom and up
through the whole set) and pushing with my heels.

## WOD

4 Rounds for Reps

- 5 Back Squats @70% of 1RM
- Max Unbroken Ring Rows (up to 20)

Between each round, rest 2x as long as your round took.

I used {% w 155lb %} for back squats and did {% w 20,8,8,7 %} ring rows.
