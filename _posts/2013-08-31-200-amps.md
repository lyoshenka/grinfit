title: 200 AMPs
---

I tried to play soccer with my dad and Diana this weekend, but my ankle is stil not better. I couldn't even play goalie. So I watched them play and did 200 AMPs on the sideline. 1 AMP = 1 pushup, 1 squat, 1 full-body situp. I did them in sets of 10 with random breaks between sets.
