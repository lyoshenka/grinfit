title: Boston Goalty Tourney
---

Played a really fun goaltimate tournament in Boston. The tourney was really high-level - all elite club players who play a lot of goalty. I
started out playing pretty poorly but learned a lot and got significantly better throughout the day. Our team lost all our games, but then
we played a few hours of pickup, which was even better than the games.

The main things I learned are that the easiest way to score is to get the disc in front of the goal, in the middle. Then have one person
stand behind the scoring circle (a few feet back). This forces their defender to choose to look at them or the thrower. It also makes sure
they can't hang out in the middle, and have to either play tight on you (which lets you cut in for the goal) or play loose, which lets the
thrower throw it over them to you. You can also score by making a horizontal cut behind the goal into the scoring space. In general, as with
ultimate, its easiest to score by cutting into the space where you want the disc, not by already being there.

After the tourney, we went to a space-themed Halloween party, played a bunch of flipcup, ate delicious pie, and hoverboarded on PK's balance
board. I got home after 3am.
