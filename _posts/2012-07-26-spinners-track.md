title: Spinners Track

Spinners ran a track workout and then scrimmaged. I'm still resting my quad so I didn't run. Instead I did pushups, crunches, leg raises, and an exercise for my back where you're in a plank position and you alternate bringing one knee up toward your shoulder, then the other knee. I don't know what it's called but it's pretty tiring.

After the track, we went up to the field and scrimmaged. We worked on making sure the disc does not stay on the sideline. Our D looked strong, though we had some trouble scoring from the red zone.

After the scrimmages, we had a fun scrimmage where we split up by SAT score (smart vs dumb). The smart team won the scrimmage 3-0.
