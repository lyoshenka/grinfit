A day full of ultimate. In the morning, Justin and I played a hat tourney at Edgely. Team "Favorite Nonalcoholic Beverage" played three games. The first two were close but not that serious (we won the first, lost the second). The last game was against Dre and Billy's team, which got me really fired up to win. We didn't play well at first, but went on a strong 5-point run to take half. We held our lead through the second half (though they narrowed the gap) but gave up two breaks on universe point to lose the game. Most of our team was pretty young, but we also had a few more experienced players. It was a great mix and we had a lot of fun. 

After the games, Justin, Maddie and I hit up Chipotle and then swung by Sedgely for a bit of disc golf. We met Panna and Billy at hole 3 and played till the 9th hole. Then Anna picked me up and we headed off to indoor spring league.

We had a double header against Dre's team and then Butter's team. The first game was close for the whole game, but in the 4th quarter we made a concerted effort to move the disc quickly and not try to huck it, which helped us score a few quick breaks in a row and win the game 37-31. The second game was tougher, with us trailing by 1 for most of the game. We took the lead sometimes, but we were pretty tired and didn't have enough discipline to pull out the win. They won 31-30, handing us our first loss of the season.

And now I'm really sore.
