title: Rock Climbing at Calico Basin, Red Rocks, NV
---

Steve, Eddie and I climbed two routes at Calico Basin (near Las Vegas). Eddie led both routes, then Steve climbed, then I climbed and cleaned up. First, we climbed [Singing Love Pen](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/singing-love-pen/105733040). It's a 5.9 and the crux is pretty tough. I got through it eventually, but not without a bit of hanging on the rope. The second route was [Valentine's Day](http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/North_America/United_States/Nevada/Red_Rock_Canyon/Calico_Basin/Moderate_Mecca/Valentine_s_Day_27439.html), a fun 5.8 crack climb. It was tricky at parts, with one section that's very low on footholds, but I managed to send it on my first try. Steve also sent it, making it his first outdoor ascent.
