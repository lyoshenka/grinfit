title: Fools Fest 2016
---

Two days of semi-serious ultimate in tiger costumes. Calvinball was a prety stacked team, but we managed to play quite poorly. We lost some
games we shouldn't have (including one on universe after being up 8-2 at half), we failed to take advantage of our 2-pointer rule, and we
were overall not very focused. But that's ok, it's fools fest. Personally I tried not to play much, and I was mostly happy with how that
went. I got a layout D on a hammer, caught a two-pointer, caught a Callahan on a scoober dump, and only had a few turnovers. It was quite
windy, especially on Sunday, but even my "start-on-O-upwind" strategy failed to backfire :-).
