title: "More Climbing In Las Vegas"

Did 3 more climbs today, including one lead.

- [From Soup To Nuts](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/from-soup-to-nuts/105732239): a nice 5.7 crack with a tricky start but then smooth sailing after that. I spent most of the time halfway in the crack, halfway on the face. 
- [Abbey Road](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/abbey-road/105733046): My onsight lead, a pretty easy 5.4. It was probably too easy of a climb, but I'm not good at leading so it was fun to practice. Plus it set us up for our next climb, which I considered leading but chickened out because it looked tough and not well protected at the start.
- [Fleet Street](http://www.mountainproject.com/v/fleet-street/105732299): A tricky 5.8R face climb. Steve and Jeremy went before me so I got some beta on how to do the start (gotta smear and mantle), so that made it easier. If I hadn't seen them do it, I think I would have had a much tougher time. Either way, I really liked it. It was different from the cracks we climbed before and I felt much sketchier without the clear footholds.
