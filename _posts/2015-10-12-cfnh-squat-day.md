## Strength / Skill Work

- 3x5 Tempo Front Squat, building to 65-75% of FS. 1 squat = 5sec descent, 1sec pause, explode up, 1sec reset at the top.
- 3x8 Supinated Barbell Row (palms facing away from you)

Used {% w 105lb %} for the squats, {% w 85lb %} for the rows.

## WOD

For Time (18min Time Cap):

30/20/10 reps of:

- Front Squats @ 40% of 1RM
- Pull Ups
- 400m Run (I subbed in 24cal on the air bike)

{% w 17:15 %} with {% w 75lb %} on the front squat.

The most difficult part was the second round. The pullups got really slow (2 at a time
sometimes) and the bike was really tiring on my arms. The last set wasn't as bad because I banged out the squats and pullups in one set,
then powered through on the bike to make sure I got done before the cap.
