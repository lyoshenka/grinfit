The whole team paid the piper at practice. Lots of pushups, planks, squats, 'sun gods' (hold your arms straight out, palms up), and jogging in lockstep. Then we worked on defending upline cuts on the dump (force them in, if they go behind you then turn towards the disc and use your arms to feel where they go) and baiting an IO to the front of the stack. We also worked on communicating on our cuts so we don't have timing issues. Then we watched film for an hour at Sussex.
