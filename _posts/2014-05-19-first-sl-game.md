First summer league game of the year. We played well but got beat deep on pretty much all of their goals. Not many subs, so I played just about every point. After the game, we ran 4 160yd shuttles. Each shuttle was 4x40yds (the width of the field). 90 seconds rest between each shuttle. I ran each in ~26 seconds.
