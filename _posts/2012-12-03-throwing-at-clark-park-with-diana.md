title: "Throwing at Clark Park with Diana"
---

It was gorgeous outside today, so Diana and I went to the park to throw. It wasn't very focused, but I spent at least 10 minutes working on my backhands. I want to be more accurate on tshort backhands that require a lot of snap, but I'm usually either off-target or I gun it at the receiver.
