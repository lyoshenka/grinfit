Had practice from 9am to 1pm both Saturday and Sunday. We did a lot of scrimmaging, and I even got some reps on the D line. We also ran drills for endzone cutting and to work on flashing our mark into the lane to stop the continuation upfield. Overall I think it was a very productive weekend. I felt strong on D and mostly strong on O. I think I only had one turnover in scrimmages, and worked well in zone O and transition D. I got my feedback from Butter and he also said that he liked what he saw. His major criticism was for me to cut deep more. I did not do the best job with that today but I will continue to focus on it during regionals.

One down note: Diana hurt herself at the start of scrimmaging on Saturday. We're not sure what it is yet (x-ray tomorrow), but it's likely a broken metatarsal. If that's the case, it means about 8 weeks on crutches and no ultimate (regionals, nationals, mosh, etc). I'm still hoping that it's just a bad sprain, but if not, it would be a huge bummer.
