title: "Tataba at Home"
---

Diana convinced me to start waking up early with her on Tuesdays and Thursdays to work out at home. Today we did tabatas:

- Tabata Pullups: 9,4,2,2 and stopped after that because of my shoulder.
- Tabata Plank: wasn't that hard
- Tabata Squats: 8x15

If I get into the habit of waking up early, maybe I'll start hitting the gym before work.
