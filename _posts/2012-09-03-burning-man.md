Spent the last week at Burning Man. We got there Wednesday evening and left Monday at 5am. I spent a lot of time walking, climbing, biking and dancing. No real workouts (even though there was an actual gym there), but my quads are surprisingly sore by the end of it. I also spent an hour or two at Circus Camp, juggling and learning to unicycle. Also, obligatory handstand photo from the top of our art project - the Garden of Missed Connections.
