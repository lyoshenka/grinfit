title: "Burning Man"
---

Spent the last week at Burning Man. We got there Wednesday evening and left Monday at 5am. I spent a lot of time walking, climbing, biking and dancing. No real workouts (even though there was an actual gym there), but my quads are surprisingly sore by the end of it. I also spent an hour or two at Circus Camp, juggling and learning to unicycle. Also, [obligatory handstand photo](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0b5q0nmzbu31m8/handstand-burning-man.jpg) from the top of our art project - the Garden of Missed Connections.
