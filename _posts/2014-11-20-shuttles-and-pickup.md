Ran 6 150m shuttles with Butter and Sara. First 3 were a 50m course, last 3 were 25m course. I ran the 50m ones in about 24-25s each. The 25m ones were
27-28s each. We also warmed up by jogging the circumference of the field twice. We did long strides for the long edges and slow jog for the short edges.

Afterwards, Sara and I joined the Penn pickup crew and played ultimate for a while. She left early, I stuck around till the end. There were a few new
girls there. Two were high schoolers and one just moved to the area. One of the high schoolers had a cannon flick for her age, and the other was a good
deep cutter and receiver. Pretty sure Butter's recruiting them for his indoor team.
