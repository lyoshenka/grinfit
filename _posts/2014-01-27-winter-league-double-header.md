Played the first game with my high schooler team. We worked on setting goals that are within our control: always having a dump and not getting beat to the force-side cone. For the first half, we didn't have those explicit goals and we played pretty poorly. After half, our focus improved and we matched Gooch's team point for point. But we didn't really convert any breaks and they rode their first-half lead to the win.

I ended up staying to watch the second game and throw with Cuatro. Then it turned out that Norm's team was shorthanded, so I picked up with them for my second game. They are a more experienced and disciplined team, so our game was a lot closer. Fern played especially well for us. But Drexel put together an athletic team and pulled away in the second half to secure their victory. Two losses in one night.
