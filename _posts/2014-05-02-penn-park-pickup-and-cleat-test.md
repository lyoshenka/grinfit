Went to penn park with Diana to try out our new cleats and throw for a bit. We ended up picking up with some people who were playing there. The game was very low-level - no stalls, no calls, no real defense. But it was a great way to try out all the cleats I brought and it's always fun to run around and chase some plastic.
