Had our first practice with the final roster. Butter was there but he had just had shoulder surgery yesterday morning so he was not 100%. I took over clapping duties and some play calling when I was in. We worked on the usual things: attacking vertically and to the break side, playing defense, etc. The main new elements were working on Sauce, getting out of a hard sideline trap, and our 3on3 redzone set. The trap work was particularly useful - we do get stuck there sometimes and its good for everyone to know how to get out. I rally enjoyed playing the thrower role (5 for 5 on goals) and also attacking upline from the dump. I also really liked marking Owen. Even though I felt that I gave up the inside break too much, the sideline was happy with the mark.

One thing I did not do well is swing the disc on O. There were a few times where I got caught up in moving the disc up the force side and did not look for the break soon enough. I also got stuck clogging the dump space for Zumba on one play. I thought I was open on a late bailout in cut. He didn't look at me (which makes sense in retrospect because he was looking at his dump) so I just stood there and called for it. I should not have been there in the first place and should have gotten out sooner.

After practice, I taught Papa how to do backflips on the highjump pad. I was also gonna teach Lexa but she kneed herself in the nose on her first attempt and that was the end of that.
