title: Indoor Fall Double Header

Played against Dre's team and Satell's team. I'm becoming more convinced that a team playing their second game back-to-back is better off than their opponents who are on their first game (assuming the double header team has good numbers). We lost to Dre's team by 2 and beat Satell's team by 2, though we were up 6 on Satell in the 4th quarter and started to get lazy. Dre's team played well and did a great job poaching against us. Satell's team was on their first game of the season (we were on our 3rd), so that may have had something to do with their loss, but they also lacked strong women to match their very strong men. I think they'll get better as the season goes on.
