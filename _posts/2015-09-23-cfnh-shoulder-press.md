title: 'CFNH: Shoulder Press'
---

## Strength/Skill Work

Work on shoulder press. Build up to a heavy single. I started at 50% of my last PR (~70lb) and worked up to 1x105lb. 

## WOD

5 rounds for time of:

- 6 Push Press (from floor) @ your shoulder press 1RM
- 10 box jumps (my heel is still hurt so I subbed in 4 calories on the AirBike instead of box jumps)

I used 105lb for my weight and finshed in {% w 7:15 %}. I did the first two PP sets unbroken, and split the rest 3/3.

Feels good to back to the gym.
