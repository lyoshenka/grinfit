title: Penn Park Workout
---

Had a pretty good Amp turnout at Penn Park tonight. I didn't think I'd be able to do much except throw and do pushups, but my ankle held up pretty well. I did most of the agility drills (T-drill, sprint-and-backpedal-in-a-box drill) but stopped towards the end. Insted I ran several 40yd sprints, working on looking for the disc and then putting my head down to run.

After the agility work, we switched to the hunger drill. I could do that fine because its just running in a straight line, though my ankle was not happy towards the end. We finished with 25 AMPs and some more throwing.
