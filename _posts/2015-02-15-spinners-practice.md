title: Spinners Practice
---

Practice was basically the same as last week, except we also ran the 4on4 drill with defense and with live play after the drill starts. I played much
worse this time than last time - lots of bad throwaways, lack of focus. Not sure how much of it was mental - I told Billy that I'd be missing most of the
season and basically took myself off the team. He told me they were planning to offer me a contract and he's really happy with how I'm covering handlers
and breaking the mark around (this was before the shitty practice), but now I'll start as a practice player and maybe move onto the roster if that works
out. So now that I wasn't in the running, I think I loosened up. Stupid placebo. Need to pretend I'm staying in Philly and still gunning for a starting
spot.
