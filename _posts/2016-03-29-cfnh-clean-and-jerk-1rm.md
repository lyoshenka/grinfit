title: 'CFNH: Clean and Jerk 1RM'
---

Today was the same as yesterday, but with C&J instead of snatch. I got there early, but the place was still packed by the time I got into
the heavy sets. I guessed high for my 1rm target (didn't want to start really low like yesterday) and ended up being pretty dead-on. I
started at ~55kg and jumped up pretty quickly to about 75kg. From there, I went in small steps up to 85kg. My cleans were decent near the
end, but my jerks were pretty bad. My 85kg jerk was maybe the ugliest one I've ever done. Still, it would have counted in competition, so
I'm counting it. I tried 85 a second time and failed the jerk.
