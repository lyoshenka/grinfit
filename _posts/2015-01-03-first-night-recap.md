Taking time off again today for ankle healing and to undo whatever I did to it yesterday. I ended up playing a decent amount at the tourney. The ankle and knee did not feel great, but I limited myself to mostly O points and our roster was big enough that I played maybe a third of the points, or even less. The tourney was fun, our team was pretty good and had a bunch of cool people, and I really enjoyed myself. We went 4-2 , winning more than we lost (as I predicted). I played poorly the first game (started the tourney off with a turn on my first possession) but got better from there and had a solid finish in the last game (several layout Ds, a few goals, only one turn).
