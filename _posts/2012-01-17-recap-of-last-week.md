Tuesday: Won a core league game against Ted's team

Thursday: Won a full league game against the Drexel team, then lost a game to TKO

Saturday: Lei-out. Beat Rocktapus Prime on universe, lost to a serious team, wrecked a weak team, lost our crossover to a fairly decent but not unbeatable team.

Sunday: Lei-out again. Won our first game, beat Massive Rooster on universe with three straight breaks (though I think we took half 7-4), beat Rocktapus Prime on universe again, lost in the finals (though we could have won if we played a tighter rotation).&nbsp;

Lessons from Lei-out: hucking deep is extremely effective.
