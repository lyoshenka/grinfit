Diana, Nico, Christa and I (and Gus and Elanor) hiked the west side loop on Mount Cardigan. The weather was pretty good, not too windy and not too cold. It took us about 3.5 hours total including a short food break at the top. Here's [us on the way up](http://i.grin.io/mount_cardigan.jpg) and [a view from the top](http://i.grin.io/mount_cardigan_top.jpg).
