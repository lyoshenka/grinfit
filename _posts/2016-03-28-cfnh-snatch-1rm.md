title: 'CFNH: Snatch 1RM'
---

The plan was to start 20kg below my target 1RM, do 5 reps at that weight, 5 reps at +5kg, 5 at +10kg, then singles the rest of the way,
going up 1-3kg at a time. But I didn't really have a target, so I started way too low and spent a long time working my way up. I went pretty
strong up to 58kg, then missed 3 times at 60kg right before they closed. It only started to feel heavy towards the end, so I think I could
have hit it with a bit more time and practice. The feedback I got was to focus more on my form. I was just jerking the bar up when it got
heavy, instead of focusing on good form and using my legs to drive hard. I think my best single lift was around 55kg. It really felt solid
because I dropped under the bar and it didn't really move after. It just stopped in place, and then I squatted it up.

Long story short, new snatch PR: {% w 58kg %}
