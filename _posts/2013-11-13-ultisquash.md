First ultisquash game of the season. We had 6 guys and Andrea. We played for almost 2 hours. I'm pretty rusty and had a ton of turns, but also had a good amount of Ds. Being the tallest guy there definitely helps. 

On the way home, we saw the train leave the platform right as we got there. Adam did some baller driving to get me to the next station right as the train got there. So fast, so furious.
