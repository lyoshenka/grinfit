Played 36 holes at Sedgly (18 from blue, back back 9, front 9 from yellow/red). I'm still learning how the Comet works. It glides better but wants to go more left than the Shark. I had some nice drives but my putts still suck. That's by far the weakest part of my game. On the plus side, I hit the chains on 21 from the red on my first throw. I actually think it went in and bounced out, so that's the closest I've come to a hole-in-one (also my first birdie from red).
