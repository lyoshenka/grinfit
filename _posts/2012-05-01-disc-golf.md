Played 36 holes at Sedgly (18 from blue, back back 9, front 9 from yellow/red). I'm still learning how the Comet works. It glides better but wants to go more left than the Shark. I had some nice drives but my putts still suck. That's by far the weakest part of my game. On the positive side, I birdied hole 21 from the red tee.
