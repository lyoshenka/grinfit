Played indoor at Tee's with a bunch of AMP players and some friends. We put in a solid 2 hours of scrimmaging. I relearned for the millionth time that I'm much better at getting blocks than throwing goals (or even passes). After scrimmage, we raged at the Furfs' house and then swung by Noah's housewarming party. A grand time was had by all.
