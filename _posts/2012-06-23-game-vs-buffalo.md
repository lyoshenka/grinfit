title: Game vs Buffalo
---

Played in Buffalo against the Hunters. We jumped out to an early lead and won the game in every way. Their offense struggled (even with John Hassel) and their D only scored one or two breaks. We had 16 total turnovers the whole game, just missing our target of 14. Personally I think this was my best game so far (maybe tied with the first game in RI). 1 goal, 1 assist, 2 Ds, no turns. Also I was cutting very well, not rushing the cuts and waiting for the right time.
