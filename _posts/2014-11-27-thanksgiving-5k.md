Ran the Gobble Wobble 5K in Abington with Diana, Nico and Emily. My goal
was to stay with Nico for as long as I could, but I lost him a few minutes
in. There were a bunch of ultimate players too - I ran with Purifico for a
while in the beginning and saw Devlin and TS there too. TS started a bit
behind me but finished at the same time.

The course was pretty hilly, so I guess my time would be better if it were
flat. My time was {% w 22:34 %}. It was pretty tough in the middle going up
the big hill, but I felt good after the hill ended and pushed really hard
on the last hill to the finish line. It helped that it was cold out. I
think I would have done way worse in the summer.

Our whole crew did well. Nico hit 20:17, just shy of his under-20 goal.
Diana and Emily both got in in just under 30. Our turkey feast will be
well-deserved.
