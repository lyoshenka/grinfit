title: Pickup in Weehawken

Played some pickup in Weehawken, NJ with my dad and sister. Not the highest level, but just about everyone knew what they were doing and a few of them were pretty good. It was a lot of fun playing with my family. My dad even threw my a half-field flick for a goal. Admittedly, the field was pretty small and we were playing 5 vs 5, but it was still good. I tried to reciprocate, but didn't take the wind into account and made it a tough read. We didn't keep score and played last-back, but people weren't that eager to sub (esp at the end) so I got a lot of running in. So much running, in fact, that after we were done I realized that I did something bad to my calf. Hopefully I'm 100% for Chesapeake.
