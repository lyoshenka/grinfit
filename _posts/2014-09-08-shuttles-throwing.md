## Shuttles

- 3x150m with 50m between cones. 150s rest between each.
- 5x150m with 25m between cones. 150s rest between each, 120s before the last one.

Threw for about a minute between each shutle.

## Throwing

Spent about 10 minutes working on my throws. Primarily worked on the full-extension backhand fake to the flick throw. I have trouble getting power when coming all the way back from a full step-out. Watching Melanie throw, I noticed that she doesn't pivot the full 180 degrees on the way back. She goes about 135, with her right foot out in front of her left. That seemed to help, will try it next time. Also, gotta throw the disc more up and IO when reaching far or pivoting hard.
