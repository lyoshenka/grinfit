title: Workout Plan 2013

It's January 1st and everyone is making resolutions for next year. I don't really make resolutions, but I figured this was a good time to put my workout plan into writing to help me make sure I'm doing what I should be doing. 

## Lifting

I plan to lift 2-3 days a week, every week. Here's my set of exercises, grouped into "more frequent" and "less frequent" sets:

- Squat
- Deadlift
- Clean
- Bench Press
- Overhead Press / Push Press
- Weighted Pullup

<!--- --->

- Bent-Over Row
- Weighted Dip
- Front Squat
- Overhead Squat
- Single-leg Squat
- Single-leg Deadlift

My main goal is to squat at least twice a week. After that, I plan to do at least two lower-body exercises and two upper-body exercises each week. 

## Met-Con

I plan to do 1-2 met-con workouts a week. I'll probably keep these short to start (2-10 minutes) and see how it goes.

## Throwing

I plan to do some focused throwing at least once a week. I may not hit this goal until the weather gets warmer. I'll motivate myself by getting the Amp Challenge started soon.

## Track & Field

I don't have a concrete goal here. Once the weather is nice I plan to do some sort of outdoor workouts, but I don't have any specific plans.

## Eating

Keep doing what I'm doing, but probably eat more.
