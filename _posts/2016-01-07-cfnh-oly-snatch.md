Had trouble with my left wrist throughout the workout. It got better throughout, but I avoided going low or adding much weight. Instead I
focused on keeping the bar back, internally rotating my shoulders, and keeping my knees out. On the snatch, I worked on getting the right
form at the start (shoulders in front of the bar, tension in my back and butt and hamstrings) and on keeping the bar close and my elbows
high.
