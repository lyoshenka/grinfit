Played two games at summer league finals. We were in E/F pool and were not taking things very seriously. We played fairly well in the first game and won by a few points. In the second game, I think we came into it hoping to lose and it showed in our playing. We also let them pick up Whitney, which didn't help our cause. Regardless, I had fun hanging out and taking Sunday off.
