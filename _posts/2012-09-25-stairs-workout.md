title: Stairs Workout
---

Ran some stairs at the art museum with Diana, Patrick and the rest of the crew. Every Philly team that's vying for nationals was represented - GMG, Termites, Amp, Southpaw, even the masters team (way to go Grimes). Here's the workout:

- Every other suicides (one flight, two flights, etc)
- Every step suicides from the top (all the flights, all but the last, etc)

<!-- -->
- Every other
- Every step
- Every other
- Kareoke
- Every other
- Left leg only
- Every other
- Right leg only
- Every other all the way up

Rest

10 x sprint every other, walk down slow. This was my request, though I wish we rested even more between each rep.

Rest

5 x 10 situps at the bottom, Kleaveland, 10 situps at the top.

Bike home.
