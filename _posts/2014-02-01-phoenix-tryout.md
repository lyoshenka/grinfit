3 hours of Phoenix tryouts at Maple Zone. We spent most of the time doing drills. The first few drills were pretty cool - 4 stations, each with a different set of cuts, and you run the cuts as fast as you can. There was a straight 40, a 10yard incut followed by a 40 deep, and two drills with 2 short cuts each. We ran each set of cuts once and were timed. 

After the cuts, we had 4 more stations to rotate through: 

- baseball drill
- defense drill (defending an incut, break cut and deep cut, then later defending the dump)
- breakmark drill, then continuation cutting drill
- marking drill

Finally at the end we got to scrimmage two games to 7. I wish we had played more, but it was still fun.
