title: "Poultry Days"
---

The legendary Poultry Days tournament. Camping, carnival, chicken, beer, partying, chicken, ultimate and lots of chicken. The team names are chicken-themed, dinner is chicken and even the brick marks are chickens. The weather was awesome all weekend and the level of play varied from really low (I think we bageled our first opponents) to top-notch (finals was Team USA vs Team Canada). We had a relatively easy Saturday, only facing one team (Breasts and Thighs) that really gave us a game. But we pulled out a win to finish the day 5-0 and earn a first-round bye on Sunday. We also fit in a game of SpikeJam and many many games of Spikeball. 

After games, we hosed off, got dinner and watched the USA vs Canada showcase game while drinking tequilla mango smoothies and spikeballing at halftime. The rest of the night was approximately this: cricken/middlebury with Duke, brief visit to the carnival for beer, return to fields for the dance party, back to campsite, bed. 

Sunday started off with a big breakfast of bagels, biscuits + gravy, and fruit cups. We won our first game was against Tad's Pitt crew, then lost to Breast and Thighs in quarters. It was windier that Saturday and we struggled against their zone. After being knocked out, we played an extra game against Canada's U23 team. They went up 4-1, but we came back to win 11-9. I hit my head on the ground on a layout D early in the game and sat out the rest of it.

Overall, a great weekend.
