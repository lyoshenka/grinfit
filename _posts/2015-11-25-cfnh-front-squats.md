title: 'CFNH: Front Squats'
---

## Strength / Skill Work

- 4x8 Front Rack Lunge
- 4x90sec Plank

{% w 45,65,85,95lb %} for lunges, {% w 0,0,15,25lb %} for planks.

## WOD

14min, every minute on the minute:

- Odd minutes: 3 Front Squats from rack. Start at 70% 1RM and build (ideally to new PR)
- Even minutes: 10 situps with twist (elbow to knee on each side)

{% w 115,145,145,155,165,175,185lb %}. That's a new PR for me :-).
