The first of our regular midweek meetups. We warmed up with a bit of plyos and the give-n-go drill, then scrimmaged (5v5, then 3v3) for over an hour. It was a lot of fun. Playing with fewer players gives you way more touches and lets you feel like you're killing it on O because you're way open. On D though, its a lot tougher. I did ok for the most part. My cutting was pretty good but my deep throws were way off. Throwing higher has been helping, but now I'm sometimes throwing too high. I guess that's ok for now.

After the game, we went to Luigi's Pizza in Fairmount and talked about jersey designs. I'm starting to feel pretty good about it. They are not gonna wind up as boring as I feared.
