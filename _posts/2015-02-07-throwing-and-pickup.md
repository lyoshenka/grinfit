title: Throwing and Pickup
---

Threw with Gabe and Himalaya for about an hour at Penn Park. We mosly threw deep throws, but did some cutting and 3-man marking too. Right as we were
finishing up, pickup started. So we played for a while in the bubble, then got kicked out and played some more outside. The weather warmed up, so it was
actually really nice to play.
