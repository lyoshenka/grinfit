Two hours of mini in the hot sun. Everyone seemed somewhat tired, and we had some really long points because of that. I know I wasn't at my
peak, esp from the deadlifts, but I still did pretty well. Toward the end I got really lazy, which was a sad sight. I also got beat in the
air because I jumped early, something LD talked to me about on Thurs. I went up early for a disc that was floating because I misread it and
thought it was on it's way down. Need to work on the reads.
