## Strength

6 rounds of Snatch Complex. Start a round every 90 seconds. One round is:

- Lift Off
- Snatch Pull
- Snatch High Pull
- Power Snatch

I started with 65lb and went up to 75lb halfway through. The goal was to focus on form, not get a high weight. I still have trouble with the
bar following the correct path on the way up (not hitting my knees, touching my thighs).



## Abs

Tabata Abs. Two rounds of:

- AbMat Sit-ups
- Tuck Ups
- Russian Twists @ {% w 25lb %}
- Bicycle Kicks

My numbers were {% w 16,16,26,38,13,13,20,20 %} for a total of {% w 162 reps %}.



## WOD

4 rounds of:

- 10 Total DB Snatches @ {% w 40lb %}
- 6cals on the assault bike (subbed for 8 10m Line Touches)
- 8 Slam Balls @ {% w 20lb %}
- max reps Russian Twists w/ Slam Ball

You have 1:30 to do each round. Your score is the number of Russian Twists you get through. Rest 1:30 between rounds.

I started with a 35lb DB, but went up to 40lb after the first round because I got a lot of twists in. My numbers were {% w 27,20,20,0 %}.
The bike on the last round really killed me. I biked super slow and used up all my time. I just finished the slam balls as time expired.



## Gymnastics

I missed two weeks of the gymnastics program, so I'm doing week 2's workouts now. I didn't do everything because I was tired, but I got in

- 3x6 Slow Pushups (3 seconds down, 3 seconds up)
- 3x10 Squats with Feet Together
- 4x20sec Forward Leaning Hold
