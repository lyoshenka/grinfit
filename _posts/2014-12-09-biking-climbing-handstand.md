Climbed at PRG for at least an hour. Finally sent the red V4 in the back, started working a fun pink V3 on the right and the white V5 in the back (same
wall as the red). The pink route is gonna be great work for grip strength. The white is tough but fun, and plays to my strengths of being tall.

Afterwards, worked on my handstand in the flat area at the front.

30 min bike ride each way.
