Did some exercises from [this workout](http://ponyshape.blogspot.com/2011/05/wow-050911.html) and mixed in a few of our own.

- Plyos warmup
- Little Dipper
- 15yd Broad Jump Depth Jumps (just like the 5RFT, but with jumps for height instead of burpees)
- 2 series 15-yard cuts to corners with throws
- 3 x 30-count marking
- 6 in 60
