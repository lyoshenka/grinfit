title: Spinners Workout, Scrimmage, Disc Golf

Went to the Spinners workout and scrimmage. The workout was pretty short, but the scrimmage was two hours long and we didn't have many subs. We played a few short games, then 8 quarters of 2 minutes each, then a normal game to 11. My game was the usual story: good cutting, poor throwing. It was pretty windy, but I'm looking forward to doing a lot of throwing work. 

After the workout, I biked to Sedgely and played disc golf for a 3 hours. I learned that to putt well, just throw it at the basket.
