Played a close game against Alex Morrone's team. We started off slow but came back at the end to win it 16-14. I played an ok amount at
first, but then played most of the last few points to bring us back on top and take the win.

Straight from there, drove to Porcfest for two days of camping, LBRY and freedom.
