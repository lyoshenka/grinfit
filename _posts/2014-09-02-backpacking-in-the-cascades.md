title: Backpacking in the Cascades
---

Two days of hiking and camping in the North Cascades. We hiked about 10 miles the first day, 13 miles the second. I was pretty sore the first day and held down the back of the line. On Tueday I felt better and mostly hung in the middle. Luckily the rain held off until right after we got back to the cars.

There weren't many people on the hike, but we did see a group on horseback (lots of horse camps in the area) and several animals (many pika, a marmot and even a bear).
