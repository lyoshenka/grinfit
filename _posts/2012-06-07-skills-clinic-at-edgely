title: Skills Clinic at Edgely
---

Helped out at Zargham's skills clinic. Trent and I were in charge of teaching defense. We ran three drills (dump d, endzone d, open-field d) for about 20 min each. I hope it was useful. 

After the clinic, I got some hucking instruction from Alex Peters. Alex even got some film of me throwing. Here are the main points:

- Twist all the way around. More torque = better.
- Reach straight back with your arm straight.
- Keep the disc in line with your arm. It should be fairly inside-out.
- Throw straight forward. Lead with your shoulder and chest, follow with your elbow, then your wrist. Lots of wrist snap.
- Don't throw upward, throw straight at your target's head. The disc will naturally tend to go up a bit.
- For forehand, keep your hand facing up and parallel with the ground to throw farther.

Watch out endzone, I'm coming for you.
