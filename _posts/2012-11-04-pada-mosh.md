title: "PADA Mosh"

Played PADA Mosh with Johnny Pivotfoot. Met a lot of fun new players (mostly from NYC). We ended up losing in the upper Chumpionship to Johnny Handblock (aka Roots). We sucked pretty hard on Saturday, mostly because we had a lot of people and a lot of beer. Sunday involved fewer people and beer, so we played better. We also played with the **Pick 6** rule for most of our games. It means that if you catch a D, you can run it back until you get two-hand-touched. Then you play on from wherever you are. If you run it back all the way to the endzone, you score. We had a total of 3 runback goals on the weekend. I didn't have any, though I did throw two Rochester goals (both to Diana) and caught a Callahan.
