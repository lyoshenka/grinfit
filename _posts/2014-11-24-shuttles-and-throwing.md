title: Shuttles and Throwing
---

- Warmup plyos
- 2 laps around the field - jog the short sides, stride the long sides
- 4 resisted sprints. You sprint while someone pushes against your shoulders and slowly yields ground. After 5 seconds, they step off and let you finish
  the sprint.
- 3x150yd sprints (50yd course). Ran them in 22-23 each. Gabe and Jesse were a second or two ahead of me on each.
- 2x150yd sprints (25yd course). Don't know the times, but beat Jesse on both.
- A bit of throwing. Worked on leftie backhands.

Dinner: crepes and walk home with Butter.
