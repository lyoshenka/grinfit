2 solid hours of indoor ultimate at North Branford. I was hoping for more
people and a higher overall level, but it was pretty good considering its
thanksgiving weekend and it's our first session. We played a couple games
for score, plus a lot of just scrimmaging. Already looking forward to next
time.
