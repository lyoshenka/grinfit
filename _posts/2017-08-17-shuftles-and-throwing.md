title: Shuftles and Throwing
---

Quick workout with LD in New Haven. Warmed with the ladder, then did some throwing: windshield wipers, chip throws, leftie backhands. After
throwing, ran 3x2x150m shuttles (25m course) with 90sec rest between reps and 2min between sets. Finished with 4x15sec lateral shuffles.
Then went home and did a bunch of Zoya pushups.
