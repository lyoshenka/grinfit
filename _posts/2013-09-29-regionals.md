Crushed Regionals this weekend. We had a fairly easy Saturday, winning our pools games by a lot. We played Ant Madness in semis and had a close first half (8-6), but only gave up 1 point in the second half to win 15-7. Our finals was Sunday at 1, where we played Ambiguously Grey. We started the game with 3 straight breaks, took half 8-5 and won 14-8.

I played well for the most part on Saturday. I had 2 turnovers on hucks up the break side. Both were good decisions and almost good throws, but one was just a bit out of bounds and the second was a litte too floaty and let the defender catch up. I also got beat deep by Zach Weiss because I didn't put my head down and get in front of him on the huck. And I got rocked deep off a pull play against AG because I came too hard to try to stop the under and I was coming directly in when my guy turned and ran directly deep. If I'm gonna stay deep off the pull, I have to not bite on the in cut so hard.

One seed at nationals in 15 days.
