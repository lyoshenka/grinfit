Played a great game against Bill and Stacy's team. We were on point the whole game and executed our game plan well. We went up big in the 3rd quarter and finished the game 30-18. Ppl on the sidelines remarked that Bill's team seemed to drop a lot of discs, so our win was partially due to their bad luck (or lack of focus?). Still, we earned a spot in the finals on Sunday.
