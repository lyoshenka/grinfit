Played one day of Fools Fest on Friday, then my tendonitis started acting up and I sat out Sat and Sun. My inside backhand has really been coming along. I've been working on putting more snap on the throw, and I threw several this tourney that were a bit off but sat for long enough to get picked up by someone else. I also ran back a pick-6 for a goal.
