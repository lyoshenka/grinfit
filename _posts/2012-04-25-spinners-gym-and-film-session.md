## Part 1 - Gym

Did a bunch of things that we usually do, but modified it somewhat to account for my own gym yesterday. Here are the highlights.

- Deadlift: 5/235lb, 5/245lb, 5/255lb
- Pull ups: 4,4,3/35lb
- Press: 3x10/20lb dumbbells

I need to come up with a consistent format for listing my rounds/sets/reps. Then write an extension for Markdown to parse that and make it look nice (and easier to export later if I need to).

## Part 2 - Film

Watched the first 3 quarters of our game vs CT. Very instructive. I learned that I do a good job of staying with my man and of executing the mark we practice, but I need to adjust more for the other team's known deep threats. I got burned deep by Korber because I was fronting him (as practiced) when I should have adjusted and pushed him under. Also, I still need to figure out how to guard dumps better. I'm starting to realized that there are more nuances to dump defense than I thought.
