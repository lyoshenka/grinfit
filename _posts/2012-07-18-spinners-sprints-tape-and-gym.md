## Sprints

- 8x20m
- 6x40m
- 4x60m
- 2x80m

## Suicides

- 5x 10m, 10m back, 20m
- 4x 10m, 10m back, 30m, walk back to the line, 30m back

Each set of sprints and suicides was immediately followed by 1 minute of throwing and 2 minutes of rest

## Tape

Watched the 3rd and 4th quarter of the Detroit game. Our D was fairly solid and we often got them stuck where we wanted them, but too often we let them out at the last second (typically on an in-cut or an up-line cut).

## Gym

- Cleans: 2x155lb, 2x155lb, 3x135lb

Ben says I don't use my hips enough on cleans.
