title: Game vs. RI

We won 24-18, but I think the game was all-around crappy. We didn't play well and didn't really deserve to win, but they sucked more. I found out later that they were missing their top 4 or 5 cutters, so it makes sense that their O was sluggish. 

I had two turnovers (one to Leon in the end one that popped up from the wind, one on a fast break with 5 seconds left in the quarter when I rushed a throw). I also threw one assist. Very mediocre in general. I was close on everything but no Ds.
