5 rounds for time:

- 22 Box Jumps (20" box)
- 400m Run
- 22 Burpees
- 22 Wallballs (16lb ball)

We did it as a partner workout, so my partner and I each did half of everything (except we ran the 400m together). He was an older guy, pushing 60, so he
wend slower than I did and I had a good amount of rest. Still, he pushed hard and I went as fast as I could on the exercises, so a good workout.
