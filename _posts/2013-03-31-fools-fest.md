title: "Fools Fest"

Fools was a blast, as usual. I spent most of my time playing and partying with ShortFatGuys (mostly DoG players + Wiggins and Idaho + some younger guys from NYC and Rochester + DanD, Dana and myself), but I picked up with Penn and the GodFeathers for a few games. I think I played 11 games over 3 days. Most were foolish, but several were really intense - we had two games against Plonkers (aka Ring) and one against UVA alums (Truck Stop) that we managed to win. 

Takeaways from the weekend:

- I cut too close to the handlers. Need to clear earlier.
- I have to stop clearing up the sideline and clear to the front of the stack.
- My backhand dumps suck. Need to step out and reach farther.
- **Team defense**. We don't play enough of that in Philly.
