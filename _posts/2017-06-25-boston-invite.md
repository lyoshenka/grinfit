A weekend in Boston with Metro North 2017. I'm in the worst shape ever going into a season, with several nagging injuries. Despite that, I
still played pretty well. My two turns were both poor-decision, poor-execution hucks. I also had some mistakes on D, getting beat badly a
few times. On the upside, I had 3 Ds including a fall-over handblock on the mark, I threw some nice throws and hucks, and my legs felt ok at
the end of Sunday. Even running the nine 40s at the end (one for each OB pull all weekend) felt pretty good.
