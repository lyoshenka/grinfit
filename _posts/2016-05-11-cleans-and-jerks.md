title: Cleans and Jerks
---

## Strength / Skill Work

6 sets of: 1 Clean, 3 Front Squats, 1 Jerk. Start a set every 2 minutes (so every 2 min, do a set and the rest for the remainder of the 2
minutes).

I built up to {% w 135lb %}. Cleans felt solid, front squats were a bit tough, and jerks were quite shaky. I'm out of practice.


## WOD

2 Rounds for Time (18min cap)

- 32cal Air Bike (instead of 800m run)
- 20 Clean & Jerks

I used {% w 105lb %} for the cleans/jerks. I did all split jerks for the first round, then saw that everyone else was doing push jerks
using the clean as momentum, and realized that was way faster. I switched to that for the second round, but I'd wasted too much time and
only got through 17 reps before time expired. I'm pretty sure I could have finished the workout if I did push jerks from the start.
