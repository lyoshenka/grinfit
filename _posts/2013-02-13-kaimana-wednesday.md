Did a day hike to the [Hanakapi'ai Falls](http://www.everytrail.com/guide/hanakapi-ai-falls-na-pali-coast-kauai) along the Na Pali Coast trail. The hike is 8 miles round trip and very muddy and up-and-down, but the view is awesome the whole time. The first two miles are along the coast. You can see the ocean, the forest, the hills and you even get to see whales sometimes (we saw one spouting water). Then you get to a small beach and head inland for another two miles of almost-rainforst. The waterfall itself is very narrow but extremely tall (300ft). Eug, Tim, Krista and I jumped in and swam under the fall to hang out on the other side. The water was quite cold but very refreshing.
