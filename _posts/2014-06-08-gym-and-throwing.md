I returned to FitGym after a two-year hiatus at the Pumpatorium. They've added a few new things - non-bent bars and a new squat cage, plus a kettlebell area upstairs. I started off easy:

- Deadlift: {% w 5@135/135/185 %}
- Press: {% w 5@65/85/85 %}
- Pullups: {% w 5/4/3@25 %}
- Box jumps: {% w 5@24/24/30 inches %}

After the gym, we went to Penn Park and worked on our around throws. We practiced throwing goals into the endzone and used a mini soccer goal as a mark. We simulated a flat mark, 30 degree mark and 45 degree mark, and challenged ourselves to step out far to make the throw. The cuts were about 80% speed, but had a trailing defender to ensure that the throw is timed well and on-target. We did backhands first, then flicks. At the end, we threw hucks for a bit.
