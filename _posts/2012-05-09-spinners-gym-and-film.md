Did the usual Spinners gym workout, then watched the first quarter of our game against CTC. We made a LOT of mistakes in the beginning. I think we turned it over on just about every possession we had that quarter. We need to start our games more focused and make better decisions (every single turnover was our mistake, not their D).
