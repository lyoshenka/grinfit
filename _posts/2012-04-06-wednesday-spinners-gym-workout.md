title: 'Wednesday: Spinners Gym Workout'
---

Did a gym workout with the team at our sponsor gym in Broomall. Not my typical workout, lots of repeated stuff (squats, leg press, upside down leg press) and isolation stuff (curls, tricep pulldown, calf raises), but it was kinda cool. I also did 101 sit ups in a row.
