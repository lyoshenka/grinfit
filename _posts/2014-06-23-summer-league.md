Our team was kinda short on guys. Our opponents were short on guys and girls. They were missing Leon and possibly another guy, so they struggled against us. We took the opportunity to work on zone (1-3-3), force backhand, and break-side cuts. We were up the whole time and won without too much of a struggle (though they were close the whole way till about halftime). After the game, Obert, TS and I threw deep throws for about 20 minutes. My flicks are getting back on track somewhat. I changed my grip a bit (moved my thumb back and toward the center). I think this gives me more spin, which helps level out hucks. After that, beers and pizza.
