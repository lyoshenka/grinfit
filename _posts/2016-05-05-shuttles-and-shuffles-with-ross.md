title: Shuttles and Shuffles with Ross
---

- 4x150m shuttles (25m course). Rest 60,90,60sec.
- 5x20sec shuffles (5m course). Rest 40sec between each
- 5x 8-cone lateral hop slalom.
- 4x15sec O/D simulator. 15 seconds of cutting on a line. Offense tries to get away from defense. Defense tries to maintain good hip
  positioning and footwork to stay with offense. I did 15sec O, 15sec rest, 15sec D, then a long break (~2min), then repeat.

We also threw a bit between exercises.
