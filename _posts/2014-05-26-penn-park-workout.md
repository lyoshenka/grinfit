3 sets of 4-5 reps of exercises and sprints. One rep is this:

- do 10-20 reps of an exercise
- sprint from the start to the 25yd line, then back to the 15yd line, then to the 40
- rest while your partner does what you just did

We did 5 reps the first two times, then cut it down to 4 for the last set. Our erexcises were:

- 20 3-yard lateral shuffles
- 20 seconds moving plank
- 20 scissor jumps
- 15 full-body situps
- 20 squats (skipped these on the last set)

We took about 5 min between each set to rest and do some focused throwing. We also threw for about 15 min afterwards. I worked on tired throwing and also on my leftie roaster throw. Dan pointed out that I should try to throw it inside out because that how I'd probably use it in a game.
