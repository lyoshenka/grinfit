title: First Session at BAD
---

First day at BAD (Better Athletic Development). Some of the Metro North ppl got a class to themselves. It's pretty similar to the Spinners
workout sessions from last year, though I think Ben's stuff was better (but it's too early to judge). We worked on sprint form and power,
core stuff, and then overall fitness circuit. Core was the worst for me, but I'm sure I'll get better at it. The sprinting work was good. I
learned that I need to swing my arms higher ("cheek to cheek"), which will cause my stride to lengthen and I'll run faster. I have good
turnover, but dont gain as much ground on each step as I could. It's probably because I play defense all the time.
