title: Footwork, Lateral Work and Throwing
---

Met Miriam at Bayview Park for a quick workout. Did a bunch of ladder
drills and resisted sprints. Turns out you can make a great resistance band
by tying two bike tubes together. After that, we worked on lateral skips
(also resisted) and sprint starts. Finished with half an hour of throwing.
