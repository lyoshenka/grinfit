---

Session two of BAD. Very similar to session 1, but we worked on jumping instead of sprinting.

- Warmup
- Resisted Jumping (wearing a band around our waist)
- Several stations with jump-related exercises (depth jumps, scissor jumps, lunges)
- A bunch of core medball exercises, mostly passing a medball back and forth with a partner
- Cardio circuit (bike, trx rows, bosu pushups, scissor jumps, sled pushing!, ladder)
