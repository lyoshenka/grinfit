title: Last Regular Season WL Game
---

Played RABS in WL. We were close most of the way but got frantic on O in the 4th quarter and let them widen the lead for the win. We played pretty solidly
overall and adjusted well to their game (taking away the deep cuts and the around throws). I did not play that well down the stretch, throwing away some
bad throws in the 4th quarter. I also hurt my knee on a high layout in the middle of the game, but that seems to be doing better.
