title: Throwing and BAD
---

Half an hour of throwing with Adubs. Worked on my flicks. I'm releasing my flick too far in front of my body, which makes it hard to keep it
I/O and hard to put power on it.

After throwing, 90 minutes of BAD. Today's focus was lateral movement - resisted shuffles and shuffle suicides were the main event. Then we
did our standard medball core workout and cardio circuit. At the end, I talked everyone into doing sled push relays, which ended up being
tougher than I expected (but still fun).

Before the workout, I measured my vert. Standing vert was {% w 25" %}, and I got {% w 30" %} with the approach. This is almost exactly the
same numbers I got in Boston in 2010 (26" standing, 30" approach). I didn't warm up though, so I think I can do better. Kevin told me that I
don't swing my arms aggressively enough, and that I need to swing them straight up.
