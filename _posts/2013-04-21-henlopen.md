title: "Henlopen"
---

Henlopen, the first tournament of the season. Almost everyone on the team was from amp2012 . We played well on D but were not consistent on O. Sometimes we looked good and worked the disc well, but sometimes we would stagnate and have trouble moving the disc off the sideline. I threw a ton of same-third throws that should have been fakes-and-swings instead. 

Things to work on: footwork, avoiding low-percentage throws.

New rule: every time I throw an ill-advised huck, I get slapped in the face.

Experiment/drill: sharp-angle cuts vs wide-angle cuts.
