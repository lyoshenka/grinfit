## Shuttles

- 1x150(50yd course)
- 1x300(25yd course)
- 2x150(25yd course)

150secs rest between each, 3min rest after the 300

## Throwing

We threw between most of the shuttles. Then after we were done, we worked on throwing a dishy and cutting deep for the huck. We did that a few times with and into the wind, but only caught about half the hucks. The rest were either overthrown (with the wind) or just bad throws. After cutting for hucks, we just worked on our deep throws. My backhands are decent but my flicks are still awful.
