## Strength / Skill Work

5 rounds of:

- 5 Back Squats @ 70% 1RM
- 8 Barbell Bicep Curls

My 1RM is never really that accurate. I did my first set at 155lb, then bumped it up to {% w 165lb %} for the rest. Curls were {% w 55lb %}.


## WOD

4 Rounds for Time (8:00 Time Cap)

- 15 Wall Balls @ {% w 20lb %}
- 10 KB Swings @ {% w 53lb %}
- 10 Chin Ups (or 5 Ring Muscle Ups)

I came very close to finishing it all in 8 min, but missed by a bit. I got through all the wall balls and 4 swings on the last round before
time ran out. The chin ups were pretty tough. I think I kept putting my hands too wide on the bar to facilitate kipping, but then I didn't
get a good enough grip on it. I also tried out these new grips that they had at the gym to keep my calluses from ripping, but that made it
harder to hold onto the kettlebell and the wall ball.
