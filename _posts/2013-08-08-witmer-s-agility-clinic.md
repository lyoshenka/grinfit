title: "Witmer's Agility Clinic"
---

Went to Melissa Witmer's agility clinc at Edgely. It was focused very much on the hips and glutes. We started with a three-part warmup: moderate-speed longer-distance stuff to get our heart rate up, then dynamic stretching, then high-speed stuff to get our nervous system ready for full intensity. The last part was pretty new to me. It was very short-distance (15 yards max). The exercises were similar to what I'm used to (carioca, shuffles, butt kicks, skips, etc), but the focus is on speed and explosiveness. 

After that, we moved into the drills. There were several drills: jab step, jazz step (jab step with the inside leg), 5-10-5 cone sprints and plyo cone jumps for minimum ground contact. The emphasis was again on the hips: which way they are facing, internal vs external rotation, full range of motion and turning the hips correctly in anticipation of a change of direction.

After the last drill, we played 4-on-4 mini till it got dark.
