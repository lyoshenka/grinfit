title: 48th and Woodland Workout
---

Norm and I did a short field workout at 48th and Woodland.

- 4 suicides: 10,0,20,0. Rest while your partner sprints
- A little bit of work on jumping form.
- 3 sets of 3x40m sprints. 10 seconds between each rep, 2 minutes between each set. Start each set with a different stance (e.g. right foot, left foot, sideways right foot, backwards left foot, pushup position, etc)
- 5 in-out cuts for hucks.
- 80m of burpee broad jumps for time. Place your hands where your feet are on each burpee (no gaining distance by falling forward). Sprint back after you're done. I did it in 3:23. The first third was pretty easy and I got a lot of distance on my jumps. After that, I had to slow down and eventually rest after each burpee.
