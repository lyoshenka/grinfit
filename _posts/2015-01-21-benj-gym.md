Did day 2 of Ben's program (the lateral day), but subbed in DB Snatch for KB Swings.

My numbers:

- DB Snatch: {% w 3@45,55,55lb %}
- Bench with hold: {% w 8@135,135,140lb %}
- Front Squat: skipped this, did eccentric pistols instead. Supposedly good for my tendonitis.
- Chin up with hold: {% w 5@20 20,25lb %}
