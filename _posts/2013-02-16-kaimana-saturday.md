title: "Kaimana Saturday"

We started the tourney off with a quick loss ot UCSC Slugs Alum. I don't know how many of those guys actually went to UCSC, but they had some strong players from Sockeye, Chain, Subzero and some other teams. Their deep shots were money and we didn't play very well. Next, we beat the other two teams in our pool: Bag of Wine (the eventual spirit winner, made us 6-way funnel half a bag of wine) and Spurburry Makai (the NYC guys, only had 12 people and didn't play well). We also played tons of Spikeball between games. Summerspike - watch out.
