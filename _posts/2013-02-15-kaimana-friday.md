Kayaked for two hours on the Hanalei river. We woke up early to get some kayaking in before our flight from Kauai to Oahu. We were the first ones out there, so there wasn't much traffic. But we did see several 6-person outrigger canoe teams cruise by us. I had never really been taught how to kayak, so Bill gave me some good tips. To summarize: sit up, paddle smoothly and not to close to the kayak, look at the front tip for better steering feedback.
