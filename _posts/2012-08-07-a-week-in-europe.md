title: A Week in Europe
---

I spent the last week traveling and sightseeing in Europe with Diana. Here's some of the things I did that may count as workouts:

- Approximately 50 miles of walking (3 full days in Paris, a day in Brussels, a day in Bruges and an evening in Cologne)
- {% img :link pull-up-belfort-bruges.jpg One pullup %} and 366 stairs at the [Belfort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfry_of_Bruges) in Bruges
- About 20 minutes of throwing by the [Atomium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomium) in Brussels

Not much, and it was probably negated by all the beer, crepes and waffles I ate.
