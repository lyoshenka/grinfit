Great workout at Penn Park. We had at least 10 people. Did a bunch of things:

## Dynamic Warmups and Agility Ladder

Various jumping, twisting stretches and speed ladder drills to warm up. Some throwing as well.

## 10x80m Sprints on the Minute

Start a clock. Every minute on the minute, sprint 80 meters. Spend the rest of the time walking back to the starting line. 

This workout is supposed to be 100m, but we only had room for 80.

## Give and Go drill

Ran the one side give-n-go drill a few times. There were 4 stationary players, and we ran by them giving and going with each. We did backhands in one direction, leftie backhands in the other. We did 4 or 5 reps of this.

## Short Cutting Box

Set up a 10m box with a disc in the middle. Cut to the center, then out to a corner, then back to the center, then the next corner, etc. 3 reps of this.

## Defensive Footwork Drill

Papa and I worked on our change of direction. We worked on making the right steps and on keeping our hips square with the cutter. 

## Mini mini

Played a very small mini game.

## Greek Lady supper club

Milkshakes and gyros with everyone.
