My first Northeast regionals experience. Pool play on Saturday was fairly
easy. I think we beat every team by at least 6-7 points. Winning our pool
put us up against Slow White in semis. That was one of the best games we've
played all year. I didn't play much (only a few points), but the team
played well as a whole and we won on universe point. Since there are 4 bids
this year, winning against Slow (only the 2nd time I've ever beaten them)
made sure that we qualified for nationals, since we couldn't do worse than
3rd at that point.

On Sunday, we played Wildcard in the finals. The game was decent but they
played very strong D, went up 8-6 in the first half, then scored a few more
breaks in the second to seal the win. Then we played Slow White again in
the 2-3 placement game. Once again a solid game. This time they came out on
top. Our defense converted 2 breaks (same as Saturday) but O gave up a few
more that we couldn't make up for.

T minus 18 days until Nationals.
