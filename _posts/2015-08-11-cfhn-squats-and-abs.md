## Strength/Skill Work

- Back Squat 3x5 @ 75% 1RM
- Ab Rollouts 3x10

Used 170lb for the squats and 25lb plates on a bar for the rollout. Rollouts were harder than what I'm used to with the ab wheel.
 
## WOD

For Time:

- 20 Back Squats (from floor)
- 40 Tuck Ups
- 400m Run
- 15 Back Squats
- 30 Tuck Ups
- 300m Run
- 10 Back Squats
- 20 Tuck Ups
- 200m Run

Did it in {% w 12:29 %} with 115lb on the bar. Cleaning/pressing the bar off the floor before each set was an interesting new twist.
