## Strength/Skill Work

4 rounds of:

- 5 Eccentric Handstand Pushups, focussing on form
- 8 DB Skull Crushers

My handstand form was pretty weak. I tended to arch my back too much. Most of the reps, I focussed on bringing my ribs in, keeping my body tight, and my hands close to the wall. The coach gave me a good cue to focus on form: lie down facedown on the mat with your arms overhead against the bottom of a wall. That's the form for a handstand. Focus on what that feels like and keep that form.

For skull crushers, I used {% w 12.5# %} dumbbells, but should go up next time.

## WOD

Two 6min AMRAP WODs with a twist. Each WOD starts with a buy-in, which you have to do before you start counting rounds. 

Rest 3 min between WODs

### First WOD

Buy-in: 100m Bear Crawl. Then, with the time remaining: 

- 100m Run
- 10 Box Jumps (24in)

Did 3 rounds, the run, and 7 box jumps in the 4th round. So close...

### Second WOD

Buy-in: 400m Run. Then,

- 20 Total Walking Lunge Steps
- 10/arm DB Snatch

Got through 2 rounds plus 10 snatches with one arm.
