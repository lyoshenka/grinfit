title: Chesapeake Open
---

Won Chesapeake Open yesterday. The competition was pretty weak, so we only played one team that really challenged us. That was Termite's Entourage, whom we played in the finals. The weather was pretty windy and we failed to score many break opportunities. Some points, we would get 3 or 4 or 5 Ds but fail to convert them. We ended up winning the game 12-11 but we did not play our system well. I had two throwaways on wide-open throws that I rushed, including one in our last D point immediately after getting the D.

According to my own accounting, I finished the weekend with a D's-Turns score of 0 (don't remember if it was 3 of each or 4 of each).

On the plus side, I caught at least 7 goals on the weekend and threw 3 more. Diana threw me 3 of those goals, including one that I caught on a chest-high fully-outstretched layout. How's that for a birthday present.
