Lost two close games to finish 4th for the season. Both were solid games.
My highlights: got bunch of nice Ds, esp in the second game. Also completed
two skipsies for goals (out of three attempts). Lowlights: still more turns
than I'd like (esp first game) and some weak defense at times. I also could
have been more aggressive as a cutter throughout.
