## Strength / Skill Work

- 4x3+2 Push Press + Jerk, building
- 4x12 Barbell Russian Twist, building

Got up to {% w 125lb %} for the presses, {% w 5lb %} for the twists. I'd never done twists with the bar before, and didn't really have time
to do many.

## WOD

For Time (8min Cap):

- 100 total Russian Twist with a {% w 25lb %} plate
- 50 Push Press @ {% w 65lb %}
- ~~400m Sprint~~ 20cal on the Air Bike

I finished in {% w 6:40 %}. The push presses killed me, even though I scaled down from 75lb. I did the twists really fast (nonstop) and
crushed the air bike in 40 seconds, but struggled on the presses. At the end I was doing 2 or 3 at a time, dropping the bar to my waist,
then cleaning it back up and doing a few more. It was rough.

## Summer League

After the WOD, I went straight to summer league. I'm glad I did that, because we didn't get to play much - games got rained out right before
halftime. It really sucked, because our team was only playing with 6 players at a time (we only had 2 women) and we were up 5-3 when the
games got called. If only we'd played a few points, we could have earned a win playing 6 v 7. On the plus side, I got to go home early :-)
