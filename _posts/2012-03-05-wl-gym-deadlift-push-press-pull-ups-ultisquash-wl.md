========================================================

Thursday: WL

Lost to Butter&rsquo;s team in full for the third time this season. We played
really well, especially on D, but still lost. That puts us tied for 5th
with Drexel and TKO.


Friday: Gym

Deadlift 5,6,6 @ 205,225,255lb
Push Press 3x5 @ 95,115,115lb
Pull Ups 4,4,3 @ 45,40,35lb


Saturday: Ultisquash

Sunday: WL

Tied Brose&rsquo;s core team 20-20, then did 10 burpees, pistols, push ups and
full-body crunches. I played well in the first half, esp on D, but threw
away a LOT in the second half. Mostly deep throws to people covered by H or
bad up-line throws.
