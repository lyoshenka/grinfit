title: Summary Of The Last 1.5 Months
---

Didn't do too much in the way of workouts conditioning. Mostly played ultimate:

- 4 hours at a PoNY tryout. Didn't make the team.
- 2 days at Mixed Easterns with Metro North. Handled a lot.
- 1-day round-robin at Lums Pond in DE. Played against AG, AMP, Tyranis and Jug Handle. Also handled a good amount, primarily for the D line.
- 3 days at Windmill Windup with Cambridge. Played a lot against some good teams. Fairly happy with my play. Got one of the most difficult and awesome
  layout Ds of my life.
- 4 days of beach ultimate at Bar Do Peixe. Definitely more relaxed that the rest of the tourneys, but still a lot of fun and pretty high quality. Played
  a total of 11 games, though they were about half an hour each. Played with some awesome women, including probably the best girl in Portugal. Highlights
  include my first layout handblock, a hammer handblock, some good D and strong intensity and focus under pressure (sometimes). Also ridiculous partying
  every single night, especially Saturday and Sunday.

Today, a return to real workouts. Threw with Miriam at Wooster Square for over an hour. Worked on torso torque on my flicks, spin on my leftie backhands, and flight path on my hammers.
