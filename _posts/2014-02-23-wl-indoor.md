Played against the Heva Havas indoor team. They had a double header and looked pretty tired against us, so it wasn't a tough game. But we still tried to push ourselves to play better. They did get off too many breakside hucks, and moved the disc fairly well on O. They also hucked it deep a lot, which lead to some scores but way more turnovers. Personally I threw away a bunch by putting them just a little too far in front without enough float. Need to work on throwing to space, not to the exact spot I'm looking. Also IOs still need work. Final score: 37-24.
