title: "Concerning Rep Ranges"
---

[Interesting article](http://articles.elitefts.com/training-articles/throw-out-the-rep-ranges-a-different-perspective-edited/) about how rep ranges are not the right way to think about workout targets. But really, I think the article doesn't go far enough. Even thinking in terms of time spent exercising isn't the best. He briefly mentions energy systems but doesn't spend much time on them. I think that's the key.
