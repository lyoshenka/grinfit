Back-to-back penn park workouts. Here's what we did tonight:

- 3 sets of suicide cuts. First set was alternating backhands and forehands, seconds set was all backhands, last set was all flicks.
- 3 sets of triangle cut drill.
- Go-to drill, but each throw was intentionally high. The goal is to throw it *almost* out of reach of the cutter. The cutter's goal is to catch the disc by translating their forward momentum into a jump - the less slowing down, the better.
- Agility ladder with an in-cut at the end.
