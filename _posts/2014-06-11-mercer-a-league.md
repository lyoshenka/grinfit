Played my first A League game of the season with Roots. We played PTA, our perrenial rival. The game was close the whole way, but we pulled ahead to take half 8-6. They caught up and tied it at 9s, but we pulled away 13-10 and then closed out the game 15-13. I played most of the D points and maybe 1 O point? 

The squad is pretty stacked this year. The Sauls, Bode and Quinn are back in town, Dundala and Pauly are back from hiatus, and a few of the younger guys are looking pretty strong. As long as we don't choke when the pressure's on, we should be in good shape.
