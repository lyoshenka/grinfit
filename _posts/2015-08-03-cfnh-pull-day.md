## Strength/Skill Work

- SLDL: {% w 3x8@30lb dumbbells %}
- GHD Situps: {% w 3x15 %}

## WOD

4 rounds for time of:

- 15/arm KB Swings @ 35lb
- 15 Weighted AbMat Situps @ 15lb
- 400m Run

Time: {% w 13:04 %}

Pushed pretty hard on the WOD. I gained a bunch of time on everyone during the first 400m run, then maintained my lead throughout. People caught up to me
toward the end but I pushed hard on the last run and came in first by 2 seconds.
