We were supposed to scrimmage at Penn Park for two hours, but they shut the lights off after about 30 minutes of playing. So we worked on our deep hucks in the dark instead. The cutting practice (the shape, the turn, not slowing down while looking back) was great. The throwing part would have been great but I was rushed to throw the next throw and not being able to see your throw was really weird. 

Afterwards, I did the shuffles workout:

- 4x10secondsx5yards side shuffle with crossover on the first step out of the turn
- 2x10cut drill, again with crossover on the first step
