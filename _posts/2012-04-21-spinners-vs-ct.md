title: Practice 8-11am, then Game vs. CTC
---

Spent most of the morning practice working on marks. Here's the plan: flash for one full second, then 0, then 10, then no-around at 3-4 seconds. The no-around is 100 degrees, but think of it as a 10 mark but rotated 90 degrees. You still have to stop the IO, but only allow the dump to go directly backwards. As for guarding the dump, when the dump is on the open side, force them upfield (the no-around mark won't be very helpful here, so force the harder throw). When the dump is on the break side,  do NOT give up the upline (mark is allowing it) and force them directly back. When they are back there, give them 2-3 feet of cushion to bait the floaty dump, then get the D. Make sure to play close if the dump is even with or in front of the disc to prevent the IO.

After practice and a nap, played against CTC. We won 22-16 but I did not play well (or play much; only 5-6 points or so). I overthrew Dustin in the endzone once and threw a Ben a throw that I should not have (his defender was fouling him but he was still close and it was not a good choice). I also let Korber beat me deep, won't let that happen again.
