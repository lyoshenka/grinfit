Large group at ultisquash today - 11 guys, 4 ladies. Would have been great for two games, but there was a track meet and all the courts were taken. We had
to talk one of the trainers into switching to another court so we can have the good one. So we assigned a number to each guy and rotated everyone (every
third game was an all-guys game). As people started leaving, we consolidated and went back to standard ultisquash subbing free-for-all. We also played
games to 5 at first, then went back to 7 and finished with a hard-to-9 final that came down to the wire.
