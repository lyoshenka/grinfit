title: Amp Wins Regionals
---

We cruised through regionals, winning all our games by a good margin. No team made it to double digits against us. Our O line didn't get broken once all
weekend, and we had very few unforced turns all around. The intensity was good, even when we were winning by a lot. 

We spent an hour or so on Saturday talking about spirit. Amp often gets low spirit scores, though we don't think we have poor spirit. So there must be
something we're missing, something we need to pay attention to and improve so we're not seen as jerks. Some good points were that we want the teams we beat
to cheer for us and be proud when we represent the region. We don't have to make friendly banter on the sidelines or smile at everyone, but we do need to
respect our opponents as worthy adversaries and recognize when they are doing something well. Some teams we mentioned as examples of good spirit are Polar
Bears, Slow White, Fury, Riot, the men on CLX.

For me personally, I played well on the weekend, though I didn't play much (esp on Saturday). I did have one drop and one rushed semi-throwaway that I
should not have had, but besides that I think I was very effective all around. I did notice myself rushing during our last game. I'll try to remember that
feeling so I can notice it in myself in the future. Brayden (the AG coach) also gave me some good feedback during the game.

- When I'm marked tightly on the flick side, I lift my pivot slightly as I throw to get space. But that's still a travel. I need to either call disc space
  or do something else (pivot?) to get the space I need.
- When I'm near the endzone (or downfield too), I get locked in on one person and wait for them to make the move I want them to make. I need to be careful
  of spending too much time on one person. Instead, I should either communicate where I want them to go, or to another cutter.
- When I throw the disc laterally from the break side towards the middle, I MUST remember to cut upline immediately. I should practice this.
- I made the same dump mistake that I made a few weeks ago in practice (and Katie was my dump again). The mark was counting stalls a bit quickly, so I was
  rushed in my head. I turned to look at my dump, but then immediately turned back upfield. I need to commit to the dump and stay with her for at least a
  few seconds before looking elsewhere. She's waiting for my look to make her cut, so I can't expect her to be open right away.
- Don't rush so much. Learn to notice it and relax when it happens. I think this may lead to my frantic cutting as well.
