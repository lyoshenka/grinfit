## Gym: Bench, Squats, Dips, Cleans

- Bench: 4/170lb, 4/160lb, 4/150lb
- Squats: 5/185lb, 5/165lb, 6/165lb (worked on my form and keeping my weight on my heels)
- Dips: 6,6,7/60lb
- Power Cleans: 3x6/125lb

*(Did dips and cleans together (alternating sets) because  we were late for disc golf.)*

## Disc Golf

After the gym, went played 36 holes at Sedgely (18 blue, 18 yellow). Did not do so well on the blues, but played a lot better on the yellows. Cuatro and I beat Norm and Reznick. I lost my Shark, but bought a Comet (supposed to be just like a Shark but a bit faster and glidier). We'll see how that works out.
