title: Footwork Drills at PP

Warmed up with a few simple plyos and did jab step and crossover step on
the ladder.

3x each of the lateral movement drills from [this video](

- ABductor hops
- ADductor hops
- Ladder 1-2-stick
- Ladder crossover stick

3x shuffle 5, sprint 5, shuffle 5 the other way, sprint 10

3x 5-10-5 in each direction. Recorded my last few. I look very upright
throughout the drill, especially when I'm slowing down. Need to work on
getting low on the turn.
