title: First Fast
---

Just finished my first 24-hour fast. It was not dificult at all. I felt hungry most of the time, but it was never too distracting or annoying. I was inspired to do it after reading Eat, Stop, Eat. The author does a pretty good job analyzing the existing medical research on fasting and makes a bunch of points that seem to make sense. Hopefully it works out for me. Time to devour this burrito.
