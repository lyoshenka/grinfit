We're getting some exercise equipment to put in the basement at work. Gonna save on gym fees this year. The gym is called the Pumpatorium, and so far we have a bar, weights (in kgs) and a bench. The squat rack is on it's way, and then we'll just need a platform to lift on and we're pretty set for a while.

My first workout was a quick 4x220lb deadlift.

Before bed, I also did 2x20 pushups. Just for fun.
