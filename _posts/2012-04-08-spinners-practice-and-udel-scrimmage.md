title: "Spinners Practice and UDel Scrimmage"
---

Had Spinners practice 11-2pm, then went to UDel and scrimmaged their team (plus a few pickups) 4-7pm. My ankle didn't hurt after practice, despite playing a lot (played a bunch of O-line, which was interesting). I think I'm almost fully healed.Also, met Bill Clemente at the first practice :-)
