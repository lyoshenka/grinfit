# Spinners Practice and UDel Scrimmage

Had Spinners practice 11-2pm, then went to UDel and scrimmaged their team (plus a few pickups) 4-7pm. My ankle didn&#39;t hurt after practice, despite playing a lot (played a bunch of O-line, which was interesting). I think I&#39;m almost fully healed.Also, met Bill Clemente at the first practice :-)
