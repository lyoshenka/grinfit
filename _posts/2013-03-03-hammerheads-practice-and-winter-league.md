title: Hammerheads Practice and Winter League
---

Venose talked me into going to a Hammerheads practice. It wasn't terrible, but it was definitely a waste of time for me. We scrimmaged a lot, which was nice, but I don't see myself playing for them, not even occasionally.

After that, Keg dropped me off at Tee's for my winter league game. We were short on players (5 guys, 3 girls) but we pulled off a solid win against Venose's team.

Mega ultimate weekend over.
