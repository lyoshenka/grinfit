title: "Cool Trick to Prevent Choking"
---

Prone to choking? Wanna make sure you don't rip that pull out of bounds on universe point? Here's a neat trick: [squeeze your left hand into a fist](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2012/09/choking-pressure.aspx). A new study found that this simple move prevented players from doing poorly when the pressure was on (in their case, soccer players kicking penalty kicks in front of fans and cameras). A previous study linked the right hemisphere of your brain to superior performance in automated behaviors. The left side was linked to rumination. Therefore, the theory goes, you want less activation on your left side and more on your right when you're performing an action that you've practiced often and that should be automatic to you. Since your right brain controls your left hand, that's the perfect way to. If this saves your ass at Regionals next week, you're welcome. Btw, not sure how well this trick works for lefties. Sorry.
