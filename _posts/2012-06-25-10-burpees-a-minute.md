title: "10 Burpees a Minute"
---

Do 10 burpees every minute on the minute. If you finish early, rest until the next minute starts. Stop when you can't finish 10 in the minute.

I lasted for almost 13 minutes, doing 128 total burpees. Jeremy was still going after 16 minutes, so I joined him for his last two rounds, doing another 20 burpees.
