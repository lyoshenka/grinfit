title: An Hour Of Throwing

Went 48th and Woodland and threw with Patrick for an hour. It was very windy so we tried to throw crosswind the whole time. We went through parts 1 and 2 of [Kung Fu Throwing](http://winthefields.blogspot.com/2011/07/kung-fu-throwing.html) but had to stop early because throwing 30 yard hammers in the wind can really tear up your flick finger.
