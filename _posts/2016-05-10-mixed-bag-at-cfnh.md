## Strength / Skill Work

5 rounds of:

- 5 weighted pullups (strict)
- 5 weighted pushups

I did {% w 10lb %} for each round of pullups, and worked up to {% w 45lb %} for my last round of pushups.

## WOD

4 AMRAPs today with 2:00 rest between each


### One

1:00 AMRAP

10 Deadlifts (30sec max). Remaining time: Burpees.

I got through the deadlifts pretty quickly at {% w 185lb %}, then got in {% w 17 %} burpees.


### Two

1:00 AMRAP

10 Power Cleans. Remaining time: Push Ups

Used {% w 115lb %} for clean and hit {% w 13 %} pushups.


### Three

1:00 AMRAP

Pull ups (kipping is ok).

{% w 23 %} for me. Could have probably done 25 if I timed it better.


### Four

2:00 AMRAP

DB Manmakers. One manmaker is a DB row, pushup, DB row on the other arm, pushup, DB clean, thruster.

I got in {% w 7 %}  of them with {% w 15lb %} dumbbells. It was rough.
