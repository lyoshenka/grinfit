Played a WL game against Vanni's team. We had all of our guys there, so I didn't really play that much. They also weren't that strong, so the game was
pretty relaxed for us. My fav play of the night was Robb throwing me a thumber just outside the endzone, and then me turning and throwing Billy a
Rochester for the score. Final score: 39-15
