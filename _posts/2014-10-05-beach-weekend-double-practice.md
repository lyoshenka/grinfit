title: Beach Weekend Double Practice
---

Combo double practice and beach weekend. There wasn't much actual beach going on because it was cold and rainy, but I did jump in the ocean after practice
on Saturday. We repeated a few drills from the past (gauntlet, marking), then moved on to scrimmage. We got some good reps with zone because it was rainy
and a great chance to practice. O even played some zone to give the D some practice, but mostly O played O. The weekend was somewhat streaky, with O and D
taking turns going on runs. Our numbers were kinda low, so we all got to play a lot and get quality reps in. 

After practicing all day Saturday (with a break for lunch, Spikeball and full-team Spikejam), we went to Papa's house for dinner, 7 Wonders and Fishbowl.

On Sunday, we went back to work. It was even colder, but not terrible. After warmups and some triangle cutting drills, my knee felt painful so I stopped
playing and switched to filming. Everyone else finished out the drill and moved on to scrimmage. The level remained high throughout the day, though there
were a bit more miscues and botched Ds than the day before.
