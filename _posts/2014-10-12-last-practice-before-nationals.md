title: Last Practice Before Nationals
---

Practice was supposed to be Saturday, but it got rained out and moved to Sunday. We split the practice up into 4 sections: one for each of our Thursday
opponents plus one for us. During our section, we ran through all the plays in our playbook to make sure we have everything down pat. Then we played mini
to work on handler movement and stopping it (Cosa Nostra), worked on physical defense and poachy zone (7 Figures), and then scrimmaged with the endzone
being closed for the first 40 seconds (CLX). Overall the practice went pretty well. The O line especially played well during the scrimmages, coming back to
win the zone scrimmage after being down, and not giving up a single turn in the endzone-closed scrimmage.
