Practice 3-6 Saturday and 10-1 Sunday. Worked on a lot of things, talked about mental toughness, played lots of slap cup.

As far as ultimate goes, I did not play that well. A **lot** of turns - rushed throws, bad decisions, just not there mentally. I need to
focus on taking an extra second before every throw, even the easy ones. It may feel slow, but I think it will up my percentage. And NO HUCKS
unless its obviously the right throw.

Off the field, I killed it at slap cup.
