title: Last Practice Before Regionals
---

Practice practice practice. We worked on chips and the breakside, reviewed and pracitced our plays, and focused on good throws and 
decision-making while tired. We go to battle next weekend. #choochoo

Feedback from captains: On-field, everything is good. I'm a fairly veteran player and my instincts are right most of the time. Off-field, 
I should lead more and teach the younger players more.
