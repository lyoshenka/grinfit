I stayed with Miriam on Sunday night after Pro Flight, and she invited me to play goalty with her team. At first I thought I'd be too tired
and sore to play, but I decided to come out and see how it went. I ended up playing the whole time and had a blast. The people were fun and
we had the right number of subs - enough to feel fresh but not too many to stand around a lot. I'm still learning goalty, so I made a bunch
of mistakes, but I did mack a disc for a goal and throw a Rochester for a goal that was dropped. Overall I noticed that people have a
tendency to all hang out in and around the goal, which makes scoring extra hard. I think more discipline to stay away from the arch would
create more space and make scoring easier.
