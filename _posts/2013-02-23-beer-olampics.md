title: Beer OlAMPics
---

20 pushups, 4 pullups, a few short sprints and about 12 beers (based on my 0.11 BAC) at the AMP beer olympics. Team Death Eaters came in second by about 20 seconds, though there was some controversy and irregularities with the penalties for Sammy dropping out of the final event. Also, Panasci is king of the bag game.
