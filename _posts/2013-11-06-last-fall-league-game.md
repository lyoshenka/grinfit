Lost to team AMP again. This time we were down a bit for most of the game, but came back at the end to bring it within one before losing 15-13. I didn't play my best game and we were all kinda ambivalent the whole time. After the game, we went out to Goat Hollow, which was pretty cool except for the loud guy playing guitar and singing.
