title: "First Pumpatorium Workout"
---

Did my first workout at the basement gym. Ashley and I did the following:

- Bench: {% w 10@133, 5@155, 4@161, 3@155 %}
- Power Clean: {% w 5@111, 2x5@133 %}
- Front Squat: {% w 3x5@133 %} (each set started with a clean)

The weighs are a bit weird because they are all in kilos. 

After we finished working out, the squat rack arrived. I'll be putting it together soon.
