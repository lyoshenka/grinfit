title: "First Pumpatorium Workout"
---

Did my first workout at the basement gym. Ashley and I did the following:

- Bench: 10/133lb, 5/155lb, 4/161lb, 3/155lb
- Power Clean: 5/111lb, 5/133lb, 5/133lb
- Front Squat: 3x5/133lb (each set started with a clean)

The weighs are a bit weird because they are all in kilos. 

After we finished working out, the squat rack arrived. I'll be putting it together soon.
