Played a lot, esp on Saturday. Weather was super hot. Started off well, then went crazy and couldn't stop hucking it away. Sunday was hotter and more
humid, but we had a few subs and I felt way better. Didn't cramp at all, had 0 turns, played fairly well. 

We beat Muff N' Men in the finals to win the tourney.
