title: Summer League + Some Drills
---

Ran a few drills with Devlin and Glazer before our game. Did the 10-cut drill 3 times, then did the triangle cutting drill (cut deep, cut under, slash break, cut deep again, all while watching the throwing and cutting off their fakes) 2 times each on the forehand and backhand side.

Then played all but one point in our 15-14 loss to Rosso's team. We played quite poorly across the board, with everyone having bad turnovers and other mistakes (Betsy dropped the pull). Yet we still managed to get a bunch of breaks and win the insanely long points we played. We went up a break at 11-10, they got the break back at 13s, and then it was universe point. We even got the D fairly close to their endzone, but could not convert. They scored for the win. 

After the game we had a good showing at team hangout. I drank two smoothies from the smoothie truck (one before the game, one after) and ate a bunch of Paella from Bulb's team.
