## Warmup

Rolling, stretches, glutivation.

## On the Turf

Shuffles, side runs, ladders, lateral skips. Emphasized lateral skips for distance. 

## Dynamic Power

- Standing MedBall Rotation Toss: {% w 3x8@10lb %}
- 1-legged Hops Over Line (Front/Back, Left/Right): 3x10sec each
- Lateral Hurdle Jump: 3x5
- Agility Drill working on inside foot push, outside foot push. Cones were basically in a straight line. Focus was on IFP/OFP course correction, staying
  very close to the cones. We were basically running in a straight line, with very small steps out to the side at the cone.

## Lifting

- DB Snatch: {% w 3x5@55lb %}
- Front Squat: {% w 8,6,4@150lb %}
- Chip Up: {% w 5@27.5lb,5@30lb, 12@BW %}
- 1-Arm KB Press: {% w 3x7@35lb %}
- 1-Leg Valslide Eccentric Hamstring Curl: {% w 3x7 %}
- Bosu Ball Rollout: {% w 2x10 %}

## Conditioning

First, 3x10sec 10yd side shuffles. Then, sled pull+push. We tied a tug-of-war rope to the sled and put 270lb on it. The whole team pulled the sled toward
us, then one person pushed it back to the start. That person then jumped on top of the sled and we pulled them back. Then they jumped off and someone else
pushed it to the start. Each person pushed it back to the start once (our team had 5 ppl).
