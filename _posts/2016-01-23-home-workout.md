3 round of:

- Max Handstand Hold
- 5 Full Ab Rollouts
- 3 Pistols per leg
- 5 SLDLs per leg (35lb)

For rollouts, I did negatives on the way down and came up on my knees. For pistols, I stuggled through the first round but found my focus by
the third round and hit them all with no walls. I have to remember to focus on keeping my whole body forward and using the bounce at the
bottom for help.
