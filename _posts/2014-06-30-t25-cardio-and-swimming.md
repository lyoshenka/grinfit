Did the T25 Cardio video with my dad and Diana. It was decent, though doing it on cement was a mistake. The bottoms of my feet hurt a lot and I had to stop at a few points to rest them. Overall I didn't feel too tired, but that might be because of the breaks and the down-scaling to minimize impact. After the cardio, we swam a few laps in the pool.
