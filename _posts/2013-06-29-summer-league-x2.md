title: "Summer League x2"

Had two summer league games today. Lost them both after being up in each. We're terrible at consistently playing well. Both games, we were the better team. Our players were faster and constantly open, and our girls were awesome while their girls were either savage and tired or didn't do anything. Losing sucks.
