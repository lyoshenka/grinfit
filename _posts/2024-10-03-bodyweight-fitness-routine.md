title: Bodyweight Fitness Routine
---

I realized that I need a habit of working out daily. While looking for a pattern that would work for me, I stumbled on the r/bodyweightfitness [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/). It seems perfect, so I'm easing into it starting today.

I'm tweaking it as I work on my setup (needed a new pullup bar and dip setup).

Warmup

- foam rolling
- 2 minutes on the erg
- 5/side worlds greatest stretch
- 5/side shoulder dislocates with a band
- 5 squat sky reaches
- 15 goblet squats
- 10 [arch hangs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=7s&v=C995b3KLXS4)
- 10 bar deadlifts

3 rounds of:

- 5 shrimp squats
- 4 pullups

3 rounds of:

- 6 135lb RDLs
- 6 [pseudo planche pushups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdmg0CfMZeo)

3 rounds of:

- 25sec Copenhagen plank per side
- 10sec tucked hanging leg hold

90sec rest after each bullet point

Finished with eccentric calf raises with a 35lb db
