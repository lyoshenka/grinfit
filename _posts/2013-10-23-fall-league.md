Fall league against the Penn State team (again). They were savage, we had 1 sub of each gender. We warmed up with Spikeball, then started playing. We took half 8-4 without feeling any real pressure. After half, they came zone. It was a bit windy, but mostly it was cold, and our throws were off. We let them score 5 breaks straight before we get our shit together and started playing like a real team. I think we won the game 15-11 or maybe 15-12. Finished with some more Spikeball before the lights went out.
