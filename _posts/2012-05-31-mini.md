Played mini with some of the spinners guys. We played two sets of first-to-seven-wins. We started off with me, Billy and Jaffe vs Patrick, Brando and Dbaer. My team won the first set 7-3. We were down 3-2 or so in the second set when Glazer showed up and we started to sub. They went up 5-2 or so, but after some subbing, they all rotated to the other team and my team ended up winning 7-4. I learned that I have pretty good throws in mini.
