Played Chesapeake Invite with my new team - Termite's Entourage. This was our first real tournament together and we didn't have our full roster together, but we still kicked a lot of ass. We came in seeded 13th out of 16, but finished 5th (5-3 overall record). Our best game was probably against Drag'n Thrust. We lost to them 14-12, but it was close the whole way and we gave them the hardest game of their weekend (they ended up winning the tourney in a game against Slow White). We also had a huge comeback against Cahoots, going down 4-10 before winning on universe point 12-11 (after a very timely timeout call by Slater). 

Overall, I'm very pleased with the weekend, both from a team perspective and from my own game. I think I played more points this weekend than I did the whole season with the Spinners. I'm a little surprised that I continued to play pretty well the whole time, despite fatigue. I did make some poor decisions because I was tired, but I think I can adjust to that. On a team level, we have very little discipline on O, but with Slater throwing bombs to Sean, Frenzel and myself, we don't really need it. On D, we varied our lines some more and got some athletic Ds. We don't do anything too crazy (though we ran some good switches, as well as a lot of force-middle and force-backhand) but it seems to work well. 

I can't wait for sectionals and especially for Regionals, when we assemble our full strength.
