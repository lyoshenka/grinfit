title: Game vs Columbus Cranes
---

Played the Columbus Cranes. The word on the street was that they are athletic and looking to huck it on O and lay out on D. That's exactly what they did. We started off strong (because we didn't give the O line a chance to get broken first point :-p) but went down a break or two at the end of the first and stayed there till halfway into the fourth. We ended up winning by 3 but I think it was our worst game yet.
