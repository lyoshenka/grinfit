title: "Spinners Tryout and Winter League"

Saturday: 3.5 hours of Spinners tryouts. It was windy and cold, but that didn't bother me too much after warmups. It's hard for me to tell how I did compared to anyone. I was top ten in the beep test, but otherwise we were broken up into groups and it looked like just about everyone played decent.

Sunday: Beat Trey's WL core team 20-19. Trey wasn't there, but the game was still close. We should have won by more because we were up 8-1 in the first quarter, but then really slowed down.
