I bought a 1" bar and about 200lb worth of plates a week ago. Today was my first lifting session. The bar is clearly worse than normal
Olympic bars, but it was cheap and works well in a smaller space (my living room), so I'm not complaining too much.

3 rounds of:

- 5 Hang Power Cleans: {% w 115lb %}
- 10 Hip Thrusts: {% w 115lb %}
- 5 Slow Front Squats: {% w 115lb %}
- 10 Unstable Pushups

Finished with the usual hip/quad/ham/etc stretching.
