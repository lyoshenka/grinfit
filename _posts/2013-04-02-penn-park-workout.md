title: "Penn Park Workout"
---

Group workout at Penn Park. Did a bunch of plyos and agility work. Here's what I remember:

- 3 sets of 4 reps of: jog 10, sprint 10, walk 10. 30 seconds rest between sets.
- 3 sets of 8 depth jumps. Focus on exploding up and spending as little time on the ground as possible.
- 3 sets of 10 side-to-side hurdle jumps. Same emphasis.
- 3 sets of O vs D in-out cut sprints. Start on the middle cone, sprint to either the left or the right cone, then sprint to the opposite cone. D starts as soon as O moves, so O gets a small head start.
- 4 sets of 10 jumps for height. First and last set were off both legs, 2nd and 3rd set were 5 off one leg then 5 off the other.
- 4 sets of single-leg hops for distance. We hopped about 30 yards in one direction, then hopped on the opposite leg coming back.
- 4 tabata rounds of: U-jumps, mountain climbers, V jumps, broad jump and backpedal
- a few agility ladder sets with Void

All this was followed by supper club at La Petit Creperie.
