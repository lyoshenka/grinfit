Tonight was the first game of Competitive Fall League. Cotton Mouth&#8482; represented well. We were a bit short on players (7 guys, 5 girls) but we came out strong and closed stronger. Penn State let us go up two breaks right off the bat, then got em back to take half 8-7. We started the half with three straight breaks and then got three or four in a row to win the game 15-11. I expected more of a fight from the other team, but this makes me optimistic about the season. 

Katie and I also did a bunch of AMPs during the game and I did a few more at home to bring it up to 50.
