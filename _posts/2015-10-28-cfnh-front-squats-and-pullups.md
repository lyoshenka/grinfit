title: 'CFNH: Front Squats and Pullups'
---

## Strength / Skill Work
- 6,4,2,4,3 Front Squat (rest 1:30 after each set)
- Strict Pullups (AMRAP -1)

Squats were {% w 6@95lb %}, {% w 4@125lb %}, {% w 2@155lb %}, {% w 4@155lb %}, {% w 3@175lb %}. Pullups were pretty weak. I think I only did
3-4 each time. Was feeling pretty sore from earlier.

## WOD

For Time - 8:00 Cap

- 21,15,9 Front Squats
- 15,12,9 Pullups

{% w 4:17 %} with {% w 85lb %} for front squats.

I scaled the pullups down to 15,12,9 because I didn't think I could do 21-15-9 fast, and the goal was to go fast and not struggle too much.
It ended up being basically exactly right. I do wish I knew that Rx weight for squats was 95. I'm pretty sure I could have done that.
