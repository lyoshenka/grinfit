First night of fall league. Met my team, which turned out to be pretty
cool. I was told it was very top-heavy, but I think all the players are at
least decent. No one's unathletic. We lost our first game to Bosco's team
by 1, then beat shockey's team by 1. Everyone played well, though some of
the newer players need some coaching. I got a decent number of Ds (mostly
poach Ds) and threw some nice goals (mostly to Kamil). Indoor is a great
workout.
