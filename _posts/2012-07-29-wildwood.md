Played a good game against Yellow Sub on Sunday morning. We went up 3-0 but ended up losing by three (11-8, maybe). I had two throwaways but got several Ds and caught and threw about 6 points (including a two-pointer). We should have only lost by one because Norm dropped a two-pointer that was in his hand. Great game overall. My quad started to bother me at the end, so I sat out the next game and watched (c)rabs kick our ass. Also, worked on my leftie backhand and scoober.
