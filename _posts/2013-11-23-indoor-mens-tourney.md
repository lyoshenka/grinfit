Played a really fun and really high-level indoor tournament at MapleZone. There were 5 teams of about equal caliber:

- Rabs + Trey
- Heva Havas + Roots
- Med Men + Mazur
- Spank
- Amp + Hypnotoad + UDel + Termites (us)

About a third of the team was from our Entrapment indoor nationals crew (me, Chappers, Ducky, Weez, and Keg), and I'd played with many of the guys on Amp, but the UDel guys (Charles and Brian) were new to me. They both played well, each with at least one really nice sky. Josh also had some amazing moments, including breaking through a secret door in the endzone after a big sky. But despite the uncomfortable amounts of FUN we were having, we only went 1-3. 

Despite our record, I'm very happy with the weekend. All the teams were very evenly matched and we lost our games by 3 points or less. The team we beat went on to lose in the finals against Trabs. 3 teams were tied 2-2 and had the exact same point diff. 

Oh yea. We had a hawk disc. We scored at least one goal with it, after which the other team made us swap the disc out. They lost. Don't mess with the hawk. Just hawk it!
