We lost 15-13. Just like las year. Just like two years before that. 15-13 is my least-favorite score. The thing is that we actually played pretty well this time too. I don't remember too many stupid decisions. But we did dig ourselves into a hole early on and could not climb back out of it. Mott and Quinn both played very well, skying pretty much everyone on PTA repeatedly. Isaac and Swilson talked a big game, but I was underwhelmed by their play (though Swilson was solid on D). Having Paul and Tache back was a plus, but Adam and Dustin were out with injuries. Maybe we'll get our shit together next year.
