Our closest Woodbridge game yet. We went down a few points early, then clawed our way back to win by a couple. The endzones were really
shallow this time, so the deep game was limited. We threw a lot of difficult throws that were turns, and didn't play defense that well.
Granted, much of our team was hung over from Bosco's wedding the night before and from various other Halloween parties.
