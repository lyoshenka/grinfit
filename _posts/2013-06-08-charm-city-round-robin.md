title: "Charm City Round Robin"
---

Played a one-day round-robin in Baltimore. I had two turns (both high-release backhands) and two or three Ds. I didn't play much because I'm still trying to rest my shoulder. As a team, we played pretty well against weaker teams and not very well against AG. We struggled to move the disc to the break side (something we've been focusing on a lot this season) and we didn't do a good job taking away their deep shots (we emphasized this before the game started). We gave up fewer deep goals in the second half, but only broke them once, which wasn't enough.

Something I've been noticing lately is how really good teams are very efficient on offense. They often score in just a few throws, especially against weaker opponents. But with AMP, even when playing a worse team, we rarely score quickly. Everyone is open, but we get a lot of short-gain in-cuts. Maybe this happens because we've been emphasizing moving the disc laterally, or maybe we just don't look for the deep shots as much. But something just doesn't feel right.
