4 hours of practice at Ballfields. I played offense most of the time, which was a nice change. I think I played pretty well, though I had two back-to-back turnovers that should have both been easy goals. Besides that, I did a reasonably good job cutting, throwing and scoring. Raha even said she felt I played well. 

I think the O line won one double-score scrimmage out of three (though we won it 4-0) and also won the first red zone to 10.
