## Strength / Skill Work

4 rounds of:

- 5 Overhead Squats, building to {% w 75lb %}
- 8/side Dead Bugs

## WOD

For Time (9:00 cap)

- 12-9-6-9-12 Overhead Squats
- 30 Bicycle Kicks (15/side) after each set of squats

I just used a {% w 45lb %} bar for the squats, but probably should have gone heavier. I went of my calculated 1RM on the squats, but it was
probably somewhat old and I've gotten stronger since then.

## Gymnastics

### Support Holds On Box (5 x 30sec)

Arms fully locked out, pits of elbows forward, shoulder blades pulled back and down.  Keep torso upright, stay tight. Rest 30 seconds
between efforts.

### Push Ups (4 x 8)

2 second hold at top (hollow position) and at the bottom.  Rest 30 seconds between sets

### Arch Hold With PVC (4 sets for max time)

Rest as needed between efforts.

### Box Dips (Foot Assisted) (3 x 10)

Use feet to help with the movement so as not to overload the shoulder.  Elbows stay tight to body, chest upright, tight core.  Rest 30
seconds between sets.

### Squat Holds (5 x 30-60sec hold)

This is an active hold, not a stretch.  Perform an air squat and hold the bottom. Fight for upright torso position.  Rest as long as you
were able to hold.
