We had 9 for goalty today. The games were fairly good, but Diana pointed out that there's not enough focus on not turning the disc over, and
it's too easy to poach instead of playing tight D. There are some possible modifications we can make to help the latter, but I'm not really
sure about the former. We already keep score, but no one pays attention to it that much.
