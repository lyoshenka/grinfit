## Strength

15 min of Overhead Squat, working up to a heavy triple. I got up to {% w 85lb %} and probably could have kept going but ran out of time.


## Skills

This was supposed to be a Jump Rope tabata, but I can't jump so I subbed in a bunch of stuff:

Two rounds through of:

- Max Cals on Air Bike
- Slamballs
- Goblet Squats with Slamball
- Russian Twists with Slamball

I used a {% w 20lb %} slamball. I didn't count the reps, but I got through about 12 slams, 12-13 squats, and 24-26 twists.


## WOD

AMRAP. 4 rounds of:

With 2:00 on the clock:

- 40m OH Walking Lunge Steps
- Remaining time: max cals on the air bike

Rest 1:00 between rounds.

**Bonus:** Right at the end of the 4th round (at min. 11), complete 30 seconds of max slam balls. Each slam ball counts as 5 cals.

I got {% w 24 cals %} on the air bike and {% w 13 slam balls %}.
