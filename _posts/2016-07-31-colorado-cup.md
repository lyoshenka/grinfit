Two days of ultimate at 6000ft. Actually, the altitude didn't bother me nearly as much as I thought it would. I felt fine the whole time. We
did bring a full roster, which helped keep everyone fresh and well-rested.

On the whole, a solid weekend for the team. We lost in the finals and played some games closer than we should have (e.g. Platypi,
Blackbird). But we also had a lot of good moments and some strong comebacks. Our D was especially solid, digging us out of holes a few
times.

Personally, I ended the weekend with a +3 on my score-o-meter (Ds minus turns). My only turn was my first throw of the tourney - a dump to
Lucas that I threw a bit too hard and too wide for him to get to. I think this might be my highest score in a few years. I must be getting
old. I even called a timeout once.

Off the field, this was one of the best tourneys we've had. Hanging out with Squeege and others in CO was great. The highlight was our
2-hour-long game of Crazy Grapes in Squeege's pool. I also went motown dancing, explored downtown Denver, celebrated Kerry's birthday,
played Dominion, and watched lots of people catch lots of Pokemon.
