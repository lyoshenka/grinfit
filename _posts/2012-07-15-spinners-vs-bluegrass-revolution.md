title: Spinners vs Bluegrass Revolution
---

From Indy, we went to Lexington, KY to play the Revolution. They were missing their best player and looked weak overall. We won 27-17. I played a good amount, especially at the end when we were up a lot. Again, no turns but no Ds (though we got several team Ds from our wolf). I scored two goals and cut fairly well most of the time.

After the game, we showered (well, hosed off) and hung out at the bar waiting for our bus. We played two games of Mafia (the first had 25 people) and I won both of them (as mafia the first time, and as a townsperson the second time). Boom!
