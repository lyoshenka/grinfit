Short day. Lost to Stigmata Clemada in quarters and there were no consolation games. On the upside, we got to watch the girls play in semis and finals. They lost in the finals to a team of mostly Fury girls but they played very well. Then we watched the men's finals and ate poke. Stigmata beat Ski Patrol to win it all. After games, we swam in the ocean, hit up the Kona Brewery and said bye to Hawaii. Till next year.
