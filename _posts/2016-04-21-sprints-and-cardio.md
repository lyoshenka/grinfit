## Footwork

5 rounds through an agility ladder (icky shuffle, but with both feet touching outside the ladder) and 2 L drills.

My times started around 22-23 seconds, and came down to {% w 18:91 %} for my last runthrough. The extra touch on the icky shuffle really
threw me off at first.

## WOD

3 3:00 AMRAPS with 2:00 rest between each

## AMRAP 1

- 8 Box Jumps
- 8 KB Swings

{% w 3+15 %} rounds+reps. I started with a 30" box, but dropped down to 24" halfway through the third set. KB swings were with a {% w 35lb %}
kettlebell.

## AMRAP 2

- 8 Push Ups
- 8 Slam Balls

{% w 4+5 %} rounds+reps. {% w 20lb %} slamball, and I moved up to bar pushups (on the 24inch rung) halfway into my third set.

## AMRAP 3

- 8 Hang Power Cleans
- 16 total Lateral Hops over the bar

{% w 4+1 %} rounds+reps. The hops were easy and I did them all unbroken. The cleans were not.
