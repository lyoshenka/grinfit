First game of Mercer finals was a typical Roots finals game. We went up a few, couldn't close, and lost 19-18. We played well for the most part on both O and D. Our O line was especially strong in the second half, scoring most goals quickly and efficiently. Our D was solid, though we didn't get many takeaways. We also struggled to convert our Ds, sometimes having multiple-turn points where we had trouble getting downfield cuts. Noah was really big for us, as were Quinn and Mott. I had one turn on an IO break flick that went over my reciever's head. Otherwise I played decently well, though my D was not the best. I need to focus more on my guy and work on my footwork more.
