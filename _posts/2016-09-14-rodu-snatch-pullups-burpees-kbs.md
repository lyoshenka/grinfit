We're in Pittsburgh this week, which means Rodu is on the menu. Sadly, Rob is closing the gym in a week or two. But on the plus side, I got
one more workout in before he's gone.

## KB Warmup:

2 rounds of:

- 10 Bottom-Up KB Screwdriver
- 10 Bottom-Up KB Press
- 2 Turkish Getup


## Snatch Work

10min EMOM:

- 1 Snatch-grip Deadlift
- 1 Hang Power Snatch
- 3 Overhead Squat

{% w 5@65lb, 4@75lb, 1@85lb %}

## AMRAP

3 x 4min AMRAP:

- 5 Strict Pullups
- 10 Burpees
- 15 KB Swings @ 24kg

2min rest between rounds (or maybe 3 min??)

{% w 2+15, 1+21, 1+23 %}
