Played one of the most ridiculous tournaments ever. Most of the teams we played were pretty weak, but our last game on Saturday was against a bunch of GOAT players and some strong women. They didn't play the best defense, but when you're scoring every point on O in about 6 or 7 throws, you don't have to. Besides that game, we won the rest easily. 

I also played in the showcase game, which was North America vs The World. We had two girls from Sweden, a guy from NZ, two guys from Australia, an Asian girl, a Russian guy (Toli) and a few others. I don't remember who won because the score wasn't very important, but I'd say we won in terms of silly and showoffy play. One point, I caught a high layout D on the first throw that was almost a Callahan, then turned and threw a Rochester for a goal. Definitely a highlight of my ultimate career.
