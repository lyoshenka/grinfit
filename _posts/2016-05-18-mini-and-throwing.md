title: Mini and Throwing
---

Played a bunch of mini with team topscore. Probably played for an hour at least. Before playing, did some focussed throwing. Afterwards
hucked for ~20 min. Gonna change my pull form to be more like Cenzo's: wind up hard, pause, unwind. Focus on loading all your muscles, then
releasing them one by one. Probably start pulling from my right leg too.
