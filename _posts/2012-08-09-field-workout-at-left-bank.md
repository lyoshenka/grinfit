title: Field Workout at Left Bank
---

Did a fairly intense workout with Ross, Patrick, Norm, Diana, Saltz and Keg. It's similar to the PonyShape workouts we did last year.

- 2 rounds of 4 minutes (8 sets) of Tabata Sprints (sprint 20 seconds, stop and rest 10 seconds). We ran between two cones that were 30 yards apart. Norm won the first round, Patrick won the second. I was close to first on both rounds but closer on the first than on the second.
- 3-man marking drill. Each person marks for 30 throws total, in 10-throw sets (mark for 10 throws, throw for the other guys, mark again). We added a rule that each point block is like having marked two throws. I had a lot of point blocks, so I would not use this rule next time.
- Place two cones 40 yards apart. Split into pairs, start on opposite cones. Person A sprints to Person B and marks for 10 seconds as Person B pivots and fakes. Then Person A takes the disc and both people sprint back to the other cone. That's one rep. We did 6 reps (each person marked 3 times).
- Place two cones 10 yards apart. 4 sets of 20 seconds side-shuffle, 20 seconds rest. Touch the cone before changing directions. Focus on getting low (chest up and squat low, dont just bend over).
- AMRAP in 6 minutes: 15 pushups, 15 full-body crunches, 15 squats. I finished 5 rounds exactly.
- Focused throwing. Emphasis on pivoting and stepping out.

I was beat at the end of the AMRAP. I haven't done many Crossfit-style workouts this year and I tried to go hard (I kept up with Ross and Saltz on the first two rounds of the AMRAP), so I felt a bit nauseous. But I'm surprisingly not sore the next day, so maybe my overall strength is up.
