NY Invite. Haven't been to this tourney since 2009, when it rained insanely hard and the games did not get called off until after the fields were wrecked. Maybe they haven't been able to get the fields since...

I continued in my role as the primary O-line cutter. I think I played better this weekend. I only had 3 turnovers - two hit my receiver in the hands and one was a good look but a bit too low and too far for Benny to catch up to. I played fairly solid D after turns (and even got some D points in during the last game) but I think I could have done better. My favorite games were against Slow, Shuyamouf and CLX.

Lessons from the weekend: 

- need to continue working on my throws, especially on putting enough snap on my flicks and on reaching out on my backhands.
- am getting better with the shape of my cuts, but need to start deep cuts from closer in.
- need to work on executing the proper dump cut. I went upline a good amount but did not come across for the IO at all.
- pay more attention to the mental prep and the instructions from captains. they set the focus, but it's easy to forget what is said when you're focusing on the current point.

My stats:

- 35 O points, 8 D points
- 10 goals
- 4 assists
- 1 D
- 3 throwaways, 0 drops
