Played the Penn State team again. We were savage to start, but a few more guys showed up after we began. The first half was close with one or two breaks for both teams. We took half 8-6. In the second half, we opened with a goal and then 4 or 5 breaks in a row, then finished out strong. I don't think our O was incredibly strong, but on D they kept throwing us the disc and we converted our second-half breaks quickly.
