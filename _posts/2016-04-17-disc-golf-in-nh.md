title: Disc Golf in NH
---

Played 18 holes of disc golf with the NH crew. I played with disc golf discs, worked on my throws. I noticed that I tend to release the
drivers early, which leads them to veer left. When I try to aim more right or release them later, I don't put enough OI on them and they
veer left because of that.
