title: Shuttles, Shuffles, Pickup
---

Did the first of the new BenJ workouts with Ben at penn park.

## Shuttles

- 2x150m with 50m cones: about {% w 25 seconds %} each
- 4x150m with 25m cones: about {% w 27 seconds %} each

150 seconds rest between each rep. We threw during some of the rests but forgot during others.

## Throwing

Mel showed up during the end of our shuttles and we threw for about 15 min. I worked on my flick throws - trying to get them smooth, flat and high enough.

## Lateral Shuffles

- 4x10m shuffles with 15 seconds on, 45 seconds rest

## Pickup

Played half an hour or so of pickup in the park. It was not very high-level but a few good players were there so I got to cover them.
