title: Superbowl and Ab Rollouts
---

Did about 40 ab rollouts while watching the Superbowl. My first one was from my toes but with a pillow. The rest were from my knees. I did most of them pretty slowly, usually waiting a second or two at the bottom before coming up. Towards the end I started doing them to the sides, but it's pretty awkward.
