title: Winter League No Subs
---

Played a full 48 minutes of winter league tonight. Our team only had one sub of each gender (thanks Allie for picking up with us) so I didn't sub at all. We got crushed, but it was still good practice for playing tired. I also came to realize that Butter is right about my flicks: the shape of the throw is off, especially on inside outs. They all end up outside ins and they don't float at all. I threw at least two hucks that would have been goals except that they trailed away from the cutter at the end of the throw.
