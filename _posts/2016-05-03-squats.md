## Strength/Skills

4 rounds of:

- 3 Paused Front Squats (3-second pause at the bottom)
- 1min Air Assault Bike

Rest 2-3min between rounds.

I worked up to {% w 155lb %}.

## WOD

12:00 EMOM

Odd minutes:

- 7 Goblet Squats
- 7 KB Swings
- Max calories on the assault bike

Event minutes: rest

I used a {% w 70lb %} kettlebell for the squats and swings, and got {% w 44cal %} total on the bike. The KB is a bit heavy for me, so I
expected to have to scale down partway into the workout, but I'm glad I got through the whole thing without dropping in weight and even came
pretty close to my calorie goal (48).

Finished with 7 muscle ups and some L holds.
