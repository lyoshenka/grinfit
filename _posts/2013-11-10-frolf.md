I won the Green Jacket in my best game of frolf ever. I was -3 after 3 holes with a birdie on 1 and a mulligan-to-eagle on 3. I managed to maintain that score and par the rest of the holes, though it got hairy at times. I had a bit of a scare on 8 but managed to save par by sliding a scoober along the gravel and under a large bush. I could have even better if I didn't screw up the 7th and 8th holes (especially the 7th), and I was in great position to attempt a birdie on 9 but Steve convinced me to play it safe and take the win instead of trying to get fancy.
