title: "Spinners Tryout"
---

3.5 hours of Spinners tryouts. It was windy and cold, but that didn't bother me too much after warmups. It's hard for me to tell how I did compared to anyone. I was top ten in the beep test, but otherwise we were broken up into groups and it looked like just about everyone played decent.
