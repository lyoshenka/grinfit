title: MN Tryout 2

Second weekend of Metro tryouts. I participated in the whole thing this time. My knee felt surprisingly good - those stretches must be doing
something. On the other hand, I'm in the worst shape I've ever been going into tryouts. Possibly the worst shape at all since college. I'm
gonna have to work extra hard to get back in the groove.
