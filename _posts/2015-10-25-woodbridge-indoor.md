Played an hour of indoor at Woodbridge. We played a team of fairly young but very athletic players. They all ran pretty hard, and one guy
had really nice throws that he used to find the endzone a lot. They only had one girl, but she also played very well most of the time. She
got really tired at the end. Our team was lacking most of our strong players, and we didn't play very well at first. Eventually we got our
shit together and stopped turning it over so much.
