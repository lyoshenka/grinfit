---

## Skills

- 5x5 Power Snatch. Focus on form, don't go heavy.

I did most of my sets at {% w 85lb %}. My main issue was that I didn't extend my hips well enough and didn't keep the bar close to my body,
which also caused me to rock backwards as I moved the bar into place at the end of the lift. I got better towards the end of the reps.

## WOD

AMRAP in 15 minutes of:

- 10/arm DB Snatches
- 15 Box Jumps
- 10 Push Ups

I hit {% w 6 %} rounds plus a single DB snatch at the end. I used a {% w 30lb %} dumbbell and a {% w 24inch %} box.
