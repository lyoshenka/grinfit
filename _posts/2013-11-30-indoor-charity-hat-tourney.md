Played a few fun games at SJ's indoor hat tourney. My team was a bit stacked because I was a maybe and the team was meant to be decent even without me. But we ended up very strong, with several good club guys and some strong ladies too. We won our first two games pretty easily, then played a close game against Trey's team where we were down the whole time but came back at the end to win 14-12. In the finals, we played against another stacked team from the B pool: Billy Maroon, Izzy, a few tall dudes and some ladies that knew how to get open in the endzone. We trailed the whole time again, but closed the gap at the end. We lost by only 2 points.

A lot of people from the previous weekend's men's tourney came back out for this. It was fun to play with some of the guys I played against the last time.
