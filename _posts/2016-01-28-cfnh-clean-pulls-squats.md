title: 'CFNH: Clean Pulls & Squats'
---

- Overhead Squat: {% w 5x3: 45,65,65,70,70 %}
- EMOM Back Squat: {% w 10x3: 4@175,4@185,2@190 %}
- Clean Pull (pos1, pos2, pos3): {% w 5x2+2+2@105 %}
- Single-Arm DB Row: {% w 3x8@60 %}

After workout, put a band around my ankles and did some lateral steps (10 each way, twice) and some forward-back steps (10 each way, 3
times). Then watched people work on their kipping muscleups and tried a few. My shoulder was bothering me, so I didn't push it.
