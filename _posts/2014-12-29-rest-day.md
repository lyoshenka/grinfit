Spent the day calling doctors and insurance companies. It's impossible to
get an x-ray without first paying a doctor to give you permission, even if
you know you need one. So the best way to do that asap is to call in Friday
morning and hope they can squeeze me in.

Also convenient that Diana has crutches, or I'd be really immobile.
