Scrimmaged a few friends of the team. We played several games to 8 or to 5 on a slightly short field. I ended up playing a good amount of D and O. Played pretty well on both, but had two turns (one bad throw, one D on a dishy) and a risky throw that I probably should not have taken. Gotta have more discipline when someone calls for it.
