We lost a super close game to Detroit. They were up the whole time, but never by more than 3 or so. We came back to tie it up late in the 4th, but couldn't hold onto it. I didn't play much, but I was mostly happy with my game. I scored once, but also missed a D that I probably should have had and also got burned deep off a foul (though Art bailed me out).
