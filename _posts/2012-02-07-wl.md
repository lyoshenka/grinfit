Tied Trey's team 19-19 today. I wanted to win, but I'm very happy with how we played today. Faster subbing, better D, better (though at times still shaky) offense, more blades, more glory. Btw, my score in the "Ds minus turns" game with Diana is still 0. She's at 0 as well. Looks like it's gonna be tight to the end.
