# WL

Tied Trey&#39;s team 19-19 today. I wanted to win, but I&#39;m very happy with how we played today. Faster subbing, better D, better (though at times still shaky) offense, more blades, more glory. Btw, my score in the &quot;Ds minus turns&quot; game with Diana is still 0. She&#39;s at 0 as well. Looks like it&#39;s gonna be tight to the end.
