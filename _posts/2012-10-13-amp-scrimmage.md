A few guys and gals got together to scrimmage AMP and play some mini & spikeball. We played 3 games to 5. The first game was close, the second game they killed us, and the last game we killed them. It was nice getting in some touches while the weather is still warm. Good luck at Natties, Amp. Hope we helped.
