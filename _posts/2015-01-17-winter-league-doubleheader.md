Played against Bills team and Delaware in winter league. The first game was
very close and very heated, esp towards the end. We were up 1 most of the
game but they caught up in the fourth quarter, then passed us. We ended up
losing by 1 after some fouling and clock-rewinding in the last few seconds
of play. In the second game, Delaware was up the whole first half, but in
the second half we switched to flick and pulled away for a solid win. In
general, our team played solid O (though sometimes a bit huck happy or
risky) and fairly good but not excellent D. Personally I threw and caught a
bunch of goals, but also had a lot of turns on rushed goal attempts and
inside backhand breaks. Those are my two areas of focus for next time.
Brandon Silverman told me during the game that I'm really good at going to
the disc, so that's another plus.
