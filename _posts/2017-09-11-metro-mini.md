Mini with Metro & friends. I felt fast, but also got tired quickly. I worked on getting low on my pivots and on triple-threat throwing on
the backhand (which messed up one of my hucks to Liz). Overall, things went well - some nice breaks and strong cutting. I guess if I have
limited time to work out, I'll take speed over endurance.
