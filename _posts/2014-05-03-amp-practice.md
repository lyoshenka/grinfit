Another amp tryout, another injury. I think I strained my quad during warmups or the first drill or something. It feels very much like the time I messed up my right quad at OMK. But this time I'm gonna take good care of it and not come back until I'm ready. So I spent most of the practice watching the drills and the grames.

20 seconds ice-cold shower.
