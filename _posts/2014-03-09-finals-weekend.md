title: Finals Weekend

Lost all three games today - two with my core team, then the finals with Off To Grandma's. We sucked in the finals. Our spacing and timing was way off, we made a lot of mistakes, and we didn't force enough turns. We had some good moments, especially in the 3rd quarter when we got a few breaks back. But it wasn't enough. They won 28-20. At least we got to do the Off to Grandma's cheer that I've been setting up all season.
