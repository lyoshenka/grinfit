Good practice. I played with the O line this time, which was a nice change for me. I think I did well overall. My spacing and timing wasn't as great as it could have been, and I threw my only turn of the day on a wide-open cut to Alex. I put too much edge on the disc and it dropped right at his feet. I also did well in the redzone scrimmge and the upline drill. On D, I played tight on my guy but got beat deep once or twice and wasn't as decisive in the zone as I should have been (pick one side and commit, don't hang out in the middle).
