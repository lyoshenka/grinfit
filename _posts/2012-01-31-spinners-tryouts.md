title: "Spinners Tryouts"
---

Went to the Spinners tryout on Saturday. It was kinda like Southpaw practice, but not as ridiculous. Didn't start too well, but finished second in survivor deep cuts and fourth (with Glazer) in survivor Roman chair. During the scrimmage, I got a bunch of Ds but also threw it away a lot. Pretty much my MO.
