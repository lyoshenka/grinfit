Two days of moshing around with Johnny Pivotfoot and the 10 Stallcounts. Made it to the finals this year, but couldn't close the deal. Probably not enough Pick 6s. I played a bunch, especially in the semis and finals on Sunday. I think my hucks and defense were my main issues, though I got a few good Ds and even had a nice box-out (though on O) that I'm usually bad at. I was really impressed with Brown and Kristen. They played a lot and maintained a high level throughout. Dorko's defense was inspirational. Colin's scoobers were pretty and pinpoint. I missed Ross and Finkbot and Amy and Dusty. Kendra had one of the best Ds of the weekend. The tall-guys/short-girls line, the short-girls/tall-guys line and the Grant/Grin/Graham line all scored their point. Shelley fed us 40lbs of chicken. What more could I ask for.

Well, I could ask for fewer stupid turns. The one I threw way out the back on a huck to Kendra. The one that got Ded in the endzone because I rushed it. The bad bladey break to Shelley that should have been an IO backhand goal. The poor huck to Brown that could have easily been a goal. The dishie in the zone to Venose that should have gone to his other shoulder. The I-didnt-warm-up-enough turn to Kristen on the very first point on Saturday morning.

The D I blinked on in the semis in the back corner of the endzone. The D on Zumba - just box him out. The one Dre threw right by my head. The IO huck I gave up first point of the finals, and the throw before that which I could have Ded if I reacted faster. The big upfield backhand that Alex broke me with - too much straightup. All the Pick 6s I forgot to run back.
