An awesome weekend of Leiing Out. All our games were really close - don't think we won any by more than 3. Our team was solid, though some people played uncharacteristically poorly. Charlie Mercer carried the team for the most part. I played alright. My throws/O/D were solid, but some decisions were poor and I missed a few plays on mental errors.

The parties were sweet. Some things I remember:

<!-- Friday -->

- pink party
- sleeping pills
- tiedye shorts and a tutu
- shotgun ok
- kamikazes
- getting uber by yelling "UBER!"

<!-- Saturday -->

- shot or text
- lindi chugging rum for everyone's texts
- cup o rum
- shirtless dancing
- yelling at the bouncer for telling everyone to be quiet
- ... and panna breaking it up
- 80 chicken nuggets
- ... under everyone's pillows

<!-- Sunday -->

- buttchugging
- Robbs OPFJ
