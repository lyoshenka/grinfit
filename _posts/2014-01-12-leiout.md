An awesome weekend of Leiing Out. All our games were really close - don't think we won any by more than 3. Our team was solid, though some people played uncharacteristically poorly. Charlie Mercer carried the team for the most part. I played alright. My throws/O/D were solid, but some decisions were poor and I missed a few plays on mental errors.

The parties were sweet. 80 chicken nuggets is never a bad call.
