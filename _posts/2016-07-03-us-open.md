title: US Open

6 games over 3 days at the US Open. We did really well, winning our pool (despite a last-game loss to Polar Bears) and then losing a close
game to Slow in the semis. Personally, I wasn't at the top of my game because my toe was killing me, but it actually got better throughout
the weekend and I played my best game against Slow. I even got a shoutout after games on Saturday for continuing to cut hard even late in
the day/tournament.

Besides the ultimate, I had a lot of fun hanging out with the team. We drank beer, went swimming in the ocean, played games, watched
ultimate, and enjoyed each others company. It was a great start to the season.
