Warmed up my throws with Diana and Bulb. Then played a decent game of ultimate. I threw away three hucks, all flickside. Two were short and bladey, the other was over Katie's head. Besides that I played well, got a bunch of Ds, and we won.

Afterwards, I ran the 10cut drill 5 times. I focused on figuring out my footwork, getting low on turns, and running at top speed the whole time.
