title: 'CFNH: Clean and Jerk'
---

- Clean from Blocks: {% w 5x3: 95,115,125,135,135lb %}
- Behind-the-Neck Jerk: {% w 5x3: 115,4@125lb %}
- Clean and Jerk: {% w 5x2@135lb %}
- Weighted Back Extensions: {% w 3x10@0lb %}

Finished up with {% w 2,2,4 %} strict muscle-ups on rings. Did each set between sets of back extensions. Tried to make each rep slow and
controlled.
