title: "Philly Invite"
---

Played our first USAU Triple Crown event - the Philly Invite. The top teams in the country were in attendance - teams 5-16 from nationals last year. This was our first weekend as a full team with a finalized roster, and we stepped up our game bigtime. We took second in our pool with a 4-1 record (beating Odyssee, Mental Toss, Slow White and 7 Figures, and losing to CLX), which put us in the championship bracket. In semis, we took down Ghosts on a universe point goal. Then in finals, we avenged our loss to CLX and won first place. On the whole, everyone played very well. Birdo and Papa especially stood out for low turnovers, a lot of Ds, tons of goals (Birdo) and strong play against tough matchups (Papa vs Stout). Personally I played ok, but I had too many turnovers (even though Butter said some of them were good turns) and was not feeling 100% strong on Saturday (don't know if it was the heat or my 2 weeks in Africa).

Firsts:

- My first real club tournament win ever.
- AMP's first tourney win since 2009.
- First time AMP beat Slow White and Ghosts (at least the first time since I started playing with AMP).
- My first between-the-legs goal (against Todd Herman - game winner vs Slow White).
- First time in many years that I seriously cramped up while playing - both calves, right shin, right bicep.
