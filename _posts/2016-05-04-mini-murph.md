## Strength/Skill

10min EMOM

Odd Minutes: 3 [Lean Away Pullups](https://youtu.be/zNMTKknjHk4) with slow, controlled descent

Even Minutes: 10 Pushups

## WOD (1/3rd of Murph)

For Time (20:00 Cap)

- 400m Run
- 33 Pullups
- 66 Pushups
- 99 Air Squats
- 400m Run

Pullups/Pushups/Squats can be broken up any way you want.

I subbed in 20cal on the air bike instead of the run. I knew pushups would be the toughest part for me (esp because we just did 50 in the
first part of the workout), so I tried to break them up in a way that made sense and then do the other stuff as rest between pushups. I
ended up doing roughly 5 pushups at a time, and alternated 5 pullups and 10 squats as my "pushups rest". The pushups still killed me, and I
switched to knee pushups after 40 or 45.

Total time: {% w 11:12 %}
