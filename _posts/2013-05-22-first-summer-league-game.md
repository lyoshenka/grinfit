Played in our first summer league game. We were missing some of our best players (Ellis, Diana, Cat) so we didn't do very well as far as score goes, but we worked on some important things. Our handling was pretty solid, our girls were better than theirs and everyone got a taste of zone. I'm looking forward to this season.
