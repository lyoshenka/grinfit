title: 'CFNH: Rope Climbs, Cleans, Burpees'
---

## Skillz

4 Rounds for Time:

- 1 Rope Climb
- 8 Box Jumps @ 24"
- 6 Power Cleans @ 135lb (dropped to 115lb after the first round)
- 4 Renegade Rows @ 30lb
- 1 Rope Climb

Rest 3:00 after each round.

My times: {% w 1:52, 2:02, 2:05, 1:55 %}

The rope climbs were tough but pretty fun. I burned my shin pretty hard on the first round. After that I found a wrist wrap and wrapped that
around my ankle. This really helped me from tearing up my shin any further, and let me come down faster on the climb down.


## WOD

CrossFit Games Open 12.1 (AMRAP - Reps)

AMRAP in 7min of burpees. On each burpee, touch a target 6" above your reach.

Got through {% w 55 burpees %}. I really focused on pace and breathing, but still came out a little too fast. I could have probably gotten
more if I tried harder to go slow in the first round. Then again, I was pretty beat from the first part of the workout, and I'm pretty weak
on pushups in general.
