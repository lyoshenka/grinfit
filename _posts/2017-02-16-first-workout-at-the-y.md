title: First Workout at the Y
---

I joined the Elm City YMCA so I can work out at a standard gym close to home. They only have one squat rack, but it looks like its not used
much, esp if I go during odd hours. 

- Front Squat: {% w 3x5@135lb %}
- Hang Power Clean: {% w 5@95,105,105lb %}
- Explosive Decline Sit Ups: {% w 10@0,10,10lb %}
- 3 Handstand Attempts
- Slow Bosu Squat: {% w 3x8@0lb %}
