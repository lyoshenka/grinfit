Norm and Eddie talked me into doing a quick workout on my way home from work:

- 60 squats
- 30 push ups
- 30 sit ups
<!-- -->
- 40 squats
- 20 push ups
- 20 sit ups
<!-- -->
- 20 squats
- 10 push ups
- 10 sit ups

While doing squats, Resnick and I tossed a disc back and forth. I got in about one throw every 2-3 squats. Lots of lefty backhands to prepare for Mosh.
