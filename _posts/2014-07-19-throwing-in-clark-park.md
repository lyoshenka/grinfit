Had a short throw session with Diana and Raha at Clark Park. We did 10-throw twice through. We didn't stand too far from each other, just focused on reps and pushing our limits. We threw a lot of throws at full extension or as high/low as we could release them. We even threw scoobers and lefty backhands. Those should come in handy at Wildwood next weekend.
