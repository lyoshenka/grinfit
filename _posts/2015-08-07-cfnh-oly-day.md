## Strength/Skill Work

- 5x5 Overhead Squat, building up to heavy weight
- 60 seconds Double Unders practice

I suck at OHS. Only got up to 55lb on that. But I did manage to do 4 double
unders in a row on two separate occasions.

## WOD

The WOD was a progression of overhead squats and double-unders, but I
subbed in 2 x singles because I can't do doubles yet.

For time:

- 10 OHS, 100 singles
- 8 OHS, 80 singles
- 6 OHS, 60 singles
- 4 OHS, 40 singles
- 2 OHS, 100 singles

I used just the bar (so {% w 45lb %}) for the squats. Finished the whole
thing in {% w 6:30 %}. The cutoff was 8 minutes for the whole thing, and
there were cutoffs for each round to move onto the next round, but I didn't
hit any.
