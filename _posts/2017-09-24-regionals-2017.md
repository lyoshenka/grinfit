We came, we saw, we conquered (except for Slow). We started the weekend off in classic Metro North fashion: by ignoring everything we
practice and jamming it in the jamhole repeatedly. But we eventually got our shit together, moved the disc well, and raised our game. The
crossover with Slow was an epic back-and-forth game, and we even got the D on the goal line on universe and had the opportunity to win it,
but a nice D by Todd got them the disc back and they converted for the win. On Sunday, we had a really close game with Xist - another
universe-point game, but this time we won it and qualified for Nationals. We played Slow again in the finals, but it was just for seeding
and half our team sat the game out.

Peronally, my main errors were on hucks. When I'm rushing my huck or I feel like I have to throw it (when we call Sausage), it never goes
well. When I'm throwing in a power position or it feels natural, I'm great. Besides that, my game was great - solid defense (including
several points where not only did my guy never touch the disc, but I felt like he was never open at all), strong cutting, and consistently
moving the disc to the breakside. My only turns were 3 hucks, and only one of them was a bad decision. I even felt strong and fast all
weekend, never feeling like I cannot keep up with my defender or cannot keep cutting well.
