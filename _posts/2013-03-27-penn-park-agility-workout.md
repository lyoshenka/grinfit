title: "Penn Park Agility Workout"

Did some sprints, cutting drills and throwing at Penn Park. We did:

- Speed Ladder warmup and plyos
- Windshield wipers 10x2
- Suicides with catches on in cuts and a deep shot x4
- Agility Cross x4
- Speed ladder to slalom to accelerate x10

Should be a nice warmup for Fools Fest.
