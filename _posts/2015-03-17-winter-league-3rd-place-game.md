title: Winter League 3rd Place Game
---

Played Delaware in the WL chumpionship. Our team played quite well overall, and I finally had a game where I'm happy with pretty much everything I did. I
subbed fast, I only threw one turnover, and I was fairly effective on O and D. I even threw Diana a huck for a goal and intentionally macked a hammer to
Furf for a goal (against the rules, I know, but it was awesome). I'd say the biggest difference between that game and our semis game was the feeling of
relaxation. I did not feel pressure, I did not rush my throws or decisions, everything was more relaxed and smoother. I don't know how much of that is
because we weren't in contention to win the league, how much was because of skill differences (Del was not bad, but they play a slower college style), how
much was something else. I will meditate on this some more.
