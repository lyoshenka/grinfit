## Ultisquash

Played a bunch of ultisquash in the morning. We hav enough people for two games, so we played pretty much nonstop. I was undefeated until the very last game.

## Amp Indoor

Another great indoor session. We spent more time working on downfield cutting. One thing we did was eliminate the dump in several drills. We also worked on cutter timing and some short 3 on 3 drills. We finished with a bunch of scrimmages, throwing, rolling and dinner at Butter's house. 

My indoor throws have definitely been improving. Fitness is still a bit lacking, though that may be because of the ultisquash.
