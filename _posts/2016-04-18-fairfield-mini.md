An hour of mini with the FFLD people. My throws were better and my D was reasonably good, but I still get tired too quickly and need more
recovery time between points than I'm used to.

While we were playing, a guy came up to us and started talking to us. Turns out he used to play for Sockeye back in the late 90s and is now
coaching a local high school. I think we'll be seeing more of him.
