An hour of 3-on-3 with the South/West Philly Amp crew. We did 3 minutes on, 3 minutes off. The weather was really hot and the turf at Penn Park made it even hotter, so the pace of the game was not the highest. Still, it was good practice. My throws and cuts were somewhat lazy at times, but other times I played strong D and cut well. I did have a few bad turnovers, still not focusing on my decisions enough.

After mini, I did this week's shuffles (8x10secondsx5yards, 30seconds rest inbetween) with Bulb and Diana. I focused on staying light on my feet in the middle and exploding out of the plants at the ends.
