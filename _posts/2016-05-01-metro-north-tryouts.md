Tryouts went 3-6pm Saturday and then 9am-noon on Sunday. The format was mostly this: warm up, a bit of cutting/throwing drills, 3v3 mini,
4v4 full-field, 7v7 full-field. I had a lot of fun both days, playing against good players and being outside. The weather was a bit cold and
rainy today, but it really was not a problem.

Personally, I feel a bit more tired that I should (and felt somewhat more tired throughout the weekend then I think I should). I'm chalking
it up to early-seasonness, but I don't think I've felt this way in previous seasons (even last season, when I took 5 weeks off in
April-May). However, my flick hucks were pretty good for most of the weekend (only had one mistake), my breaks were solid, and my D was good
for the most part. I had a lot of trouble with Korber and Match, but did a good job on just about everyone else. My main problem was my
backhand hucks (I'm 0-for-2) and timidness in the air (got skied a few times when I shouldn't have). My I/O flick was also a bit shitty at
times during mini, but that's probably due to fatigue for the most part.
