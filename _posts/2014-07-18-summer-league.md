A tight summer league game against Trey's team. We played really well in the first half were up two breaks at halftime. In the second half, we had a bunch of unforced short-field turnovers and they won 15-11. We still played solid defense, but could not overcome all the mistakes. In general, our O was strong when we didn't turn it early. We did a good job opening up space in the middle of the field for the players who were being left uncovered. They then worked it to each other and marched the disc up the field into the endzone. I'm pretty happy with how we did, especially considering that Jeff, Katie and Diana were not playing (though we picked up Yoli to take Diana's spot).
