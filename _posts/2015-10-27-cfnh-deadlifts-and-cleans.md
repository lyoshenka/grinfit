title: 'CFNH: Deadlifts and Cleans'
---

## Strength / Skill Work

- 4x Power Clean Complex (3 DL + 3 Power Cleans + 3 HPC, rest 1:30)
- 4x8 Dead Bugs (8/side, rest 1:00)

Don't take your hands off the bar. Build each set so the last one is tough, but with proper form.

I topped out at {% w 115lb %} for the complex.

## WOD

3 rounds for time:

- 15 Power Cleans
- 20 Tuck ups
- 15 Deadlifts

Clean and DL weight is the same. Should be one you can do the cleans in 2-3 sets. Do not exceed 85% of part 1.

I finished in {% w 9:04 %} with a {% w 100lb %} bar.
