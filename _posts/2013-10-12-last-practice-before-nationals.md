title: Last Practice Before Nationals
---

Had a fairly light practice. We worked on several play calls, did a few pull play scrimmages and some transition work, worked on our redzone O and our marks, scrimmaged and threw deep in the wind. I played with the O line again so I'll be ready to fill in on O when needed. I had some unusually bad turns on O, including a drop on a wide-open pass. D was better - definitely feeling faster after the last two weeks of easier and more consistent workouts. Looking forward to one last high-intensity workout on Monday or Tuesday to seal the deal.
