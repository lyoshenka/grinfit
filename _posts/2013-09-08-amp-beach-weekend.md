title: AMP Beach Weekend
---

A fun and useful weekend of practices, beach play and hanging out. The schedule:

Friday night: fishbowl charades game.

Saturday morning: Grass practice. We worked on dumps to the open side, then redzone offense, then scrimmage. My ankle held up pretty well throughout, though its not 100% yet. Offense won the first scrimmage, defense won the second.

Saturday afternoon: Beach practice. Playing in the wind and on the sand was great. We did a breakmark drill and the Petter drill. The wind really added a new level of difficulty. Then we split into 3 teams and played a round-robin tournament with the non-playing team doing Jamals, agility and throwing drills while the other teams played 4 on 4.

Sunday night: pool, grilling, crossdressing, psychiatrist, football via Apple TV.

Sunday morning: Back to grass. Did a Jackpot drill for vert stack and ho stack, then a bunch of O vs D scrimmaging, then a breakmark throwing/marking drill, and one final scrimmage. I started doing drills but sat out for all of the scrimmages at first. Then I got back in for the second drill and played the last game to 5. My ankle still needs time off. Major icing and ibu still needed. Also got my captain feedback: I need to get faster. 

Sunday afternoon: more pool, hoagies, Space Jam.
