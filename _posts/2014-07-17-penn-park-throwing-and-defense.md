Second workout of the day. I skipped out on most of the sprints, shuttles and hill sprints because I lifted earlier. Instead I threw with Gabe and Maddie. Then I worked on defensive positioning and threw some more.

For the record, here's the workout:

## 20m Sprints

Do a bunch of 20m sprints with different starts. Start facing different directions, loading one leg or the other, leaning forwards, stepping backwards, etc. My favorite was to set up as if you're covering someone in the stack and have them cut in while you chase. If the defender beats the cutter to the line, they win a prize (in this case, a chicken wing). Rest for full recovery between sprints.

I skipped everything but the O-D sprints.

## Shuttles

Sprint 50m, do 5 side-to-side shuffles between two cones, sprint 50m, shuffle again, sprint 50m. Not sure what the rest is, I'd do 1-2min.

## Hill Sprints

I didn't see what they did because I was throwing, but I did discover that Penn Park has some nice short hills to sprint up.

## Defense Drill

Did Nick's box drill several times. Worked on focusing on my defenders hips, staying close to them and being on the correct side of them. Also on my footwork. Papa pointed out that on Amp, we tend to spend a lot of time watching the disc when our person is not active. That's important, but we should be spending more time watching our person and only glancing at the disc momentarily to get an idea of what's going on. This will let us react faster to our person making a move, and we'll be closer on the D.
