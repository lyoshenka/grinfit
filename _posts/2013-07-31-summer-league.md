Played a summer league game against Venose's team. I think they must have been missing people because we won pretty handily. Diana came a bit late, but once she got there, I threw her at least 4 goals. Overally I threw at least 7 hucks for goals and caught a couple of goals myself. 

After the game, we (Diana, Birdo, Devlin and I) ran the 10-cut shuttle drill 4 times. On the last time, Birdo and I threw a disc to each other at each cone.
