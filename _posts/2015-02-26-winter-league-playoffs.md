Started the playoffs with a game against Vanni's team again. They scored the first few, but then we jumped out to a 10-3 lead and never looked back. We
got pretty sloppy in the fourth, messing around and throwing fullfield hammers and thumbers. We just barely missed the big 4-oh, winning 39-16 or so.
