## Sprints

5 sprints through a 6-cone serpentine, finishing each with a sprint to the start. 2min rest between sprints.

My times: {% w 13.07, 12:45, 12:11, 12:04, 12:11 %}. 12:04 was also the class record. I tried several times to beat it but couldn't quite do it. I also ran
one lap at 11:37 but we're not counting it because I missed two cones.

## WOD

"The Warmup WOD""

15min AMRAP:

- 25m High Knees
- 25m Butt Kicks
- 10m of Inch Worms (no push up)
- 20 Walking Lunge Steps
- 10 KB Swings
- 10 Goblet Squats

I used a 44lb KB for the swings and squats. Got through 4 rounds + everything up to KB swings on the 5th round. Could have probably banged out the swings
and squats if I'd had another 40 seconds or so.

## Bonus

I was the only person in the class, and we had some spare time at the end, so I worked on bar muscle ups. I ended up doing one clean muscle up on the bar -
possibly my first ever that I did with good form.
