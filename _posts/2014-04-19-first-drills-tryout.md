title: First Drills Tryout
---

Did our first structured tryout. We did several drills (give-n-go, breakside cuts, 3 on 3 for 3, 3 on 3 for 2 turns) and then went to a full 7 on 7 scrimmage. It was a bit windy and I threw some bad throwaways. I'm also out of shape after not running for a few weeks. But it will come back to me.
