title: Winter League, Spinners Practice
---

Lots of utlimate tonight: core winter league at Ampro, then Spinners practice at Tee's. I got lucky and found rides from/to everything.

## Winter League

We played a great game tonight and pulled off a strong win against a (possibly) better team. We stuck to our goals (don't get beat to the force-side cone, always have a dump), played great defense and smart offense. We got out to an early lead and held it the whole game, never letting them come within 3 points. Thanasis and Eddie had a great game, coming up with some nice Ds and some big skies. Our ladies also did well on offense, and their defense is improving each game. 

To be fair, Jake's team was missing Jack Kelly and Jake was not at 100% because he's just coming back from a long hamstring injury recovery. But I still think we played our best game yet and the improvement is very encouraging. I did not expect us to win a single game this season and had switched focus to coaching and working on fundamentals. But maybe that's the secret?

## Spinners Practice

After our game, Jake and I went to the practice. We did a short warmup, some 3-man handler weaveing, a drill to work on our first step, and then some scrimmaging. We mostly worked on dumps to the open side (and dump defense). We also played 2-minute segments with no subs, alternating 5v5 and 4v4. Finally, we played a few 5-minute quarters with subs. 

I felt pretty good throughout the practice. It was really cold at Tee's and my hands were freezing, so my throws were not as quick or accurate as usual. But the main thing that's holding me back right now is fitness. I gotta in better shape. Also, better footwork would be great. Ben's first-step drills should be helpful here.
