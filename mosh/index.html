    <p>Had an excellent time playing with the Molar Bears at Mosh this weekend. For a first-year team, we set the bar pretty high for level of play, level of
fun, and finish in the tourney (lost in the finals). The wind was rough and the cold was somewhat annoying, but I had a lot of fun.</p>

<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>

<ul>
  <li>drinking tea on the sideline</li>
  <li>recruiting for the team turned out awesome</li>
  <li>everyone was very positive, had a lot of fun and partied pretty hard (though separately). need to have unified party next time.</li>
  <li>every team except Trey’s played pick-6</li>
  <li>the rollers-are-live rule was fantastic in strong wind</li>
  <li>my wind throws have gotten better, and my throwing turns came more from lazy throws</li>
  <li>we beat Trey’s team on universe</li>
  <li>jeremy skied 3 guys in the endzone while wearing fairy wings</li>
  <li>jeremy dropped a hand-on-hip hammer for an upwind break in the finals</li>
  <li>papa owes me a buffalo</li>
  <li>I threw a Rochester for a goal (to the break side to the front of the stack)</li>
  <li>I threw Diana a honey goal. She played with her boot on and still got Ds and was effective.</li>
  <li>the costumes. next year, no jerseys</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bicuspids bite, molars crush<br />
Bears love cold. Let’s win Mosh</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>

<ul>
  <li>if the wind is so strong that scoring upwind is tough, choosing the wind is equivalent to choosing O/D</li>
  <li>conversely, starting on O upwind is good for focus and mental prep. accept the challenge.</li>
  <li>we lost in the finals in part because of lack of leadership.
    <ul>
      <li>we were up 7-5 after half and playing D downwind. we should have broken for 8-5, then
overloaded our O and sealed the deal</li>
      <li>millersville adjusted to our strategy at half. we didnt. we should have tried to play more handler-y O going downwind, and I should have called
handlers (scottie and brown) to play upwind O points.</li>
      <li>I should have put myself into the cup to stop their crashes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>as the captain, I did a good job keeping the vibe positive but I did not attend to the team’s needs. I got caught up playing and talking from the
sideline, but I needed to take a step back (multiple times throughout the game) and ask myself “what does the team need? what have I done already and
what am I not doing yet?”</li>
  <li>catch my Ds, then run them back for goals</li>
  <li>continue to work on throws in the wind, esp flicks and hammers and short-range throws</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days of moshing around with Johnny Pivotfoot and the 10 Stallcounts. Made it to the finals this year, but couldn’t close the deal. Probably not enough Pick 6s. I played a bunch, especially in the semis and finals on Sunday. I think my hucks and defense were my main issues, though I got a few good Ds and even had a nice box-out (though on O) that I’m usually bad at. I was really impressed with Brown and Kristen. They played a lot and maintained a high level throughout. Dorko’s defense was inspirational. Colin’s scoobers were pretty and pinpoint. I missed Ross and Finkbot and Amy and Dusty. Kendra had one of the best Ds of the weekend. The tall-guys/short-girls line, the short-girls/tall-guys line and the Grant/Grin/Graham line all scored their point. Shelley fed us 40lbs of chicken. What more could I ask for.</p>

<p>Well, I could ask for fewer stupid turns. The one I threw way out the back on a huck to Kendra. The one that got Ded in the endzone because I rushed it. The bad bladey break to Shelley that should have been an IO backhand goal. The poor huck to Brown that could have easily been a goal. The dishie in the zone to Venose that should have gone to his other shoulder. The I-didnt-warm-up-enough turn to Kristen on the very first point on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The D I blinked on in the semis in the back corner of the endzone. The D on Zumba - just box him out. The one Dre threw right by my head. The IO huck I gave up first point of the finals, and the throw before that which I could have Ded if I reacted faster. The big upfield backhand that Alex broke me with - too much straightup. All the Pick 6s I forgot to run back.</p>

    <p>Played PADA Mosh with Johnny Pivotfoot. Met a lot of fun new players (mostly from NYC). We ended up losing in the upper Chumpionship to Johnny Handblock (aka Roots). We sucked pretty hard on Saturday, mostly because we had a lot of people and a lot of beer. Sunday involved fewer people and beer, so we played better. We also played with the <strong>Pick 6</strong> rule for most of our games. It means that if you catch a D, you can run it back until you get two-hand-touched. Then you play on from wherever you are. If you run it back all the way to the endzone, you score. We had a total of 3 runback goals on the weekend. I didn’t have any, though I did throw two Rochester goals (both to Diana) and caught a Callahan.</p>
