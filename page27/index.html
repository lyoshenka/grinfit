    <p>3 hours of Phoenix tryouts at Maple Zone. We spent most of the time doing drills. The first few drills were pretty cool - 4 stations, each with a different set of cuts, and you run the cuts as fast as you can. There was a straight 40, a 10yard incut followed by a 40 deep, and two drills with 2 short cuts each. We ran each set of cuts once and were timed.</p>

<p>After the cuts, we had 4 more stations to rotate through:</p>

<ul>
<li>baseball drill</li>
<li>defense drill (defending an incut, break cut and deep cut, then later defending the dump)</li>
<li>breakmark drill, then continuation cutting drill</li>
<li>marking drill</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally at the end we got to scrimmage two games to 7. I wish we had played more, but it was still fun.</p>

    <p>Played against the Spinners team (the Baers, Brando, Zargham, etc). They were missing half their guys, but still gave us a great game. I don&rsquo;t think the point diff was ever more than 4, and the final score was 32-31. We won on a last-second Raha handblock and score to go up 1, then a D from Satell to seal the win.</p>

<p>I did not play very well. It was cold and my hands were freezing again, so my throws were not good. I was also pretty tired from yesterday, so my D was weak at times. Now it&rsquo;s time for a day off to prepare for Phoenix tryouts tomorrow night.</p>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Lots of utlimate tonight: core winter league at Ampro, then Spinners practice at Tee&rsquo;s. I got lucky and found rides from/to everything.</p>

<h2>Winter League</h2>

<p>We played a great game tonight and pulled off a strong win against a (possibly) better team. We stuck to our goals (don&rsquo;t get beat to the force-side cone, always have a dump), played great defense and smart offense. We got out to an early lead and held it the whole game, never letting them come within 3 points. Thanasis and Eddie had a great game, coming up with some nice Ds and some big skies. Our ladies also did well on offense, and their defense is improving each game.</p>

<p>To be fair, Jake&rsquo;s team was missing Jack Kelly and Jake was not at 100% because he&rsquo;s just coming back from a long hamstring injury recovery. But I still think we played our best game yet and the improvement is very encouraging. I did not expect us to win a single game this season and had switched focus to coaching and working on fundamentals. But maybe that&rsquo;s the secret?</p>

<h2>Spinners Practice</h2>

<p>After our game, Jake and I went to the practice. We did a short warmup, some 3-man handler weaveing, a drill to work on our first step, and then some scrimmaging. We mostly worked on dumps to the open side (and dump defense). We also played 2-minute segments with no subs, alternating 5v5 and 4v4. Finally, we played a few 5-minute quarters with subs.</p>

<p>I felt pretty good throughout the practice. It was really cold at Tee&rsquo;s and my hands were freezing, so my throws were not as quick or accurate as usual. But the main thing that&rsquo;s holding me back right now is fitness. I gotta in better shape. Also, better footwork would be great. Ben&rsquo;s first-step drills should be helpful here.</p>

    <p>Played the first game with my high schooler team. We worked on setting goals that are within our control: always having a dump and not getting beat to the force-side cone. For the first half, we didn&rsquo;t have those explicit goals and we played pretty poorly. After half, our focus improved and we matched Gooch&rsquo;s team point for point. But we didn&rsquo;t really convert any breaks and they rode their first-half lead to the win.</p>

<p>I ended up staying to watch the second game and throw with Cuatro. Then it turned out that Norm&rsquo;s team was shorthanded, so I picked up with them for my second game. They are a more experienced and disciplined team, so our game was a lot closer. Fern played especially well for us. But Drexel put together an athletic team and pulled away in the second half to secure their victory. Two losses in one night.</p>

    <p>An awesome weekend of Leiing Out. All our games were really close - don&rsquo;t think we won any by more than 3. Our team was solid, though some people played uncharacteristically poorly. Charlie Mercer carried the team for the most part. I played alright. My throws/O/D were solid, but some decisions were poor and I missed a few plays on mental errors.</p>

<p>The parties were sweet. Some things I remember:</p>

<p>Played more amp. We spent more time focusing on cutting. Did a new drill where one cutter cuts in, catches the disc, and hits a second in-cut at an exact location. The goal is for the second cutter to time their cut so they get the disc i nstride at the correct spot. We also scrimmaged a lot.</p>

<p>90 seconds rest between sets</p>

<p>Diana and I also started a Paleo diet for the next 4 weeks as part of Lift&rsquo;s Quatified Diet experiment. Each person gets randomly assigned to one of 10 diets, and they track how you do (how you feel, your weight, etc). Paleo was one of the more restrictive diets, and also one of the most different from my normal diet. So this should be fun.</p>

<p>Played a bunch of ultisquash in the morning. We hav enough people for two games, so we played pretty much nonstop. I was undefeated until the very last game.</p>

<h2>Amp Indoor</h2>

<p>Another great indoor session. We spent more time working on downfield cutting. One thing we did was eliminate the dump in several drills. We also worked on cutter timing and some short 3 on 3 drills. We finished with a bunch of scrimmages, throwing, rolling and dinner at Butter&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>My indoor throws have definitely been improving. Fitness is still a bit lacking, though that may be because of the ultisquash.</p>

    <p>An awesome 2 hours. We did some short stretches and drills, then scrimmaged a lot. First drill was a give-and-go drill with 3 stationary receivers and one cutter running down the middle of the field. I liked the drill, but I&rsquo;m unsure about the in-game usefulness. Going from catch to throw quickly was good practice. But when I try to do this move in a real game, the hardest part is throwing to a moving cutter while also moving.</p>

<p>After that drill and a 1-on-1 cutting in space drill, we played a bunch of scrimmages. For the first few, we were not allowed to throw the disc backwards. For the last few, it was just standard indoor ultimate with a slightly longer stall count.</p>

<p>I need to match up against Papa more.</p>

    <p>Played a close game against Zaarz (Zargham + Laarz). Finished tied at 25s. Nothing particularly good or bad. A bit sloppy at times, should not have turned it over so much, mostly from rushing.</p>
