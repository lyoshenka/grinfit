    <p>Last regular-season game, and it&rsquo;s against the 1 seed. They didn&rsquo;t play like they&rsquo;re the best team in the league, but they did beat us by 10 or so and they are solid all around. We played pretty well, and having Leo really helps. He&rsquo;s a great thrower and he knows when to cut deep. If only we&rsquo;d had Tom, Ashley and Ashley, we could have had a really close game.</p>

    <p>Beat Trey&rsquo;s team by 1 point in an exciting back-and-forth indoor game. We finally had our whole team. They were missing Trey, but had everyone else. They played the Trey zone with TC as the big man deep, but we were disciplined enough to work through it most of the time. We also played well on D and got a decent number of blocks on dumps to TC. He played really well and did almost everything for them. But in the end, Ashley put up a full-field buzz beater to Tom to win it.</p>

    <p>Played against the Heva Havas indoor team. They had a double header and looked pretty tired against us, so it wasn&rsquo;t a tough game. But we still tried to push ourselves to play better. They did get off too many breakside hucks, and moved the disc fairly well on O. They also hucked it deep a lot, which lead to some scores but way more turnovers. Personally I threw away a bunch by putting them just a little too far in front without enough float. Need to work on throwing to space, not to the exact spot I&rsquo;m looking. Also IOs still need work. Final score: 37-24.</p>

    <p>3 days of gorgeous weather, high-level ultimate and awesome partying &hellip; or at least that&rsquo;s the pitch. Unfortunately, this year did not live up to expectations.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>

<p>The weather on Saturday was not bad. It wasn&rsquo;t sunny, but at least there was no wind and the ground was fairly dry. We played 3 teams - Maui Mana (a local team), Colony (an Australian club team preparing for worlds), and Club Prince (a Madcow-Bravo combo team). All the games were lopsided. We crushed Maui and got our ass kicked by the other two. The game against Prince was a bit closer than the other, but the finals score was 15-7 or so. We didn&rsquo;t play great.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>

<p>The weather got worse on Sunday. There was a lot of rain and the ground was very muddy by the time we played (11:45am start times today and yesterday). We played another local team and wrecked them, then played KUT (Carleton Alum) and got killed again. I skipped the second half of the first game and the first half of the second game to pick up with Ski Patrol, which made my day much more interesting. They were mostly Seattle guys with a few outside pickups (Brown, Zargham, Lucas). They play a very different style of ultimate - much more relaxed and dynamic, but still focused. I wish I&rsquo;d had more time to play with them. I did get to play half a game aginst Sofia Freaks, another unique and interesting team that I love playing against. They went up in the first half and took half 8-4. After I left, Ski Patrol rallied and won the game on universe point.</p>

<p>After pool play ended, we played a prequarter game against Stanford Bloodthirsty. The game was close the whole way, with them leading by a bit, but we got a late break and won 13-12 when the game got capped. Stanford had a great deep game and their primary handlers played very well. We sucked on D and were decent on O. Everything was pretty sloppy. We also had a 15 min break when one of the Stanford guys hurt himself. In the end, the game got capped and we scored on O to win it.</p>

<h2>Monday</h2>

<p>Winning in prequarters earned us the right to play Ono in quarters. By this point, the fields were completely torn up and muddy. The wind made the game almost unplayable (it blew over the tournament tent early that morning) and most of us had trouble throwing and catching. Ono had several strong throwers, and they were able to convert several upwind breaks, which quickly lead to downwind breaks. It was shitty all around and we lost 15-6 or so.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overall I played very well for the first two days. Ignoring the Ono game (it was terrible ultimate), I had no throwing turnovers and just one drop  - a throw from Bhavin in the endzone that should have been an easy catch but I misread it a bit and then dropped the catch. I mostly cut, but did some handling and played a bunch of defense. I&rsquo;m especially happy with my offense. Maybe playing O line for Amp is a good move.</p>

It took us about two hours on the way up, an hour on the way down. Possibly the most scenic workout I&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>

    <p>Another 2 hours of ultisquash. Played with some of the greats in the game: Schmucker, TC, Wheels, Raha, Diana. We had some really heated and competitive games. I spent a bunch of time covering Schmucker and even got some Ds on him, so I think my game is improving. My throws still need work though. I need to do a search for how often I&rsquo;ve used that phrase (or some variation of it) on this blog.</p>

<p>I ended the session pretty banged up: slightly rolled ankle, almost hyperextended my elbow, sore fingers and knees, etc. It&rsquo;s gonna be nice to take the next week of in Hawaii.</p>

    <p>Played a full game against Delaware&rsquo;s college team. They were pretty athletic and had decent throws, but their girls were not great and they didn&rsquo;t have the experience we had. The game was close in the first and most of the second quarter, though it was our fault for turning over a lot of endzone opportunities. We got our shit together some more in the second half and pulled away to win by 6 or 7. I had a good amount of inside breaks for goals, but I also turned over a bunch. Butter is right, my IO flick needs work.</p>

    <p>Had a long meeting about the upcoming Amp season. We talked about the importance of player retention, changing up the practice structure (midweek practices, more intense weekends, fewer but longer weekends), focusing on cutting and on-field problem solving, tryouts and setting the roster early, and many other things. It was mostly a brainstorming session as well as a feedback-for-the-captains session. There was some disagreement about early-season tournaments and whether going to a beach weekend with a bunch of people you don&rsquo;t know is a good or bad things for new players. We also talked about holding each other accountable and creating standards of fitness. Dre mentioned that every DI program she&rsquo;s ever coached or played for has fitness standards, and they are a good way to force people to get in shape, but she would not advocate them for Amp because the primary goal is not to win a championship at any cost.</p>

<p>After the meeting, we went to Spinners practice. We mostly scrimmaged and worked on dump offense and defense. I threw some good throws but also had a few bad turnovers. My D was fairly good allaround. I&rsquo;d give me a 7 out of 10. Or maybe 6. Need more work.</p>

We got crushed, but it was still good practice for playing tired. I also came to realize that Butter is right about my flicks: the shape of the throw is off, especially on inside outs. They all end up outside ins and they don&rsquo;t float at all. I threw at least two hucks that would have been goals except that they trailed away from the cutter at the end of the throw.</p>

    <p>3 hours of Phoenix tryouts at Maple Zone. We spent most of the time doing drills. The first few drills were pretty cool - 4 stations, each with a different set of cuts, and you run the cuts as fast as you can. There was a straight 40, a 10yard incut followed by a 40 deep, and two drills with 2 short cuts each. We ran each set of cuts once and were timed.</p>

<p>After the cuts, we had 4 more stations to rotate through:</p>

<ul>
<li>baseball drill</li>
<li>defense drill (defending an incut, break cut and deep cut, then later defending the dump)</li>
<li>breakmark drill, then continuation cutting drill</li>
<li>marking drill</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally at the end we got to scrimmage two games to 7. I wish we had played more, but it was still fun.</p>

    <p>Lots of utlimate tonight: core winter league at Ampro, then Spinners practice at Tee&rsquo;s. I got lucky and found rides from/to everything.</p>

<h2>Winter League</h2>

<p>We played a great game tonight and pulled off a strong win against a (possibly) better team. We stuck to our goals (don&rsquo;t get beat to the force-side cone, always have a dump), played great defense and smart offense. We got out to an early lead and held it the whole game, never letting them come within 3 points. Thanasis and Eddie had a great game, coming up with some nice Ds and some big skies. Our ladies also did well on offense, and their defense is improving each game.</p>

<p>To be fair, Jake&rsquo;s team was missing Jack Kelly and Jake was not at 100% because he&rsquo;s just coming back from a long hamstring injury recovery. But I still think we played our best game yet and the improvement is very encouraging. I did not expect us to win a single game this season and had switched focus to coaching and working on fundamentals. But maybe that&rsquo;s the secret?</p>

<h2>Spinners Practice</h2>

<p>After our game, Jake and I went to the practice. We did a short warmup, some 3-man handler weaveing, a drill to work on our first step, and then some scrimmaging. We mostly worked on dumps to the open side (and dump defense). We also played 2-minute segments with no subs, alternating 5v5 and 4v4. Finally, we played a few 5-minute quarters with subs.</p>

<p>I felt pretty good throughout the practice. It was really cold at Tee&rsquo;s and my hands were freezing, so my throws were not as quick or accurate as usual. But the main thing that&rsquo;s holding me back right now is fitness. I gotta in better shape. Also, better footwork would be great. Ben&rsquo;s first-step drills should be helpful here.</p>

    <p>Played the first game with my high schooler team. We worked on setting goals that are within our control: always having a dump and not getting beat to the force-side cone. For the first half, we didn&rsquo;t have those explicit goals and we played pretty poorly. After half, our focus improved and we matched Gooch&rsquo;s team point for point. But we didn&rsquo;t really convert any breaks and they rode their first-half lead to the win.</p>

<p>I ended up staying to watch the second game and throw with Cuatro. Then it turned out that Norm&rsquo;s team was shorthanded, so I picked up with them for my second game. They are a more experienced and disciplined team, so our game was a lot closer. Fern played especially well for us. But Drexel put together an athletic team and pulled away in the second half to secure their victory. Two losses in one night.</p>

    <p>Played against Roots and then Trey&rsquo;s team. We played fairly well on the whole and won both games. We were a bit savage and some of our players were sick (including me). I had a few bad throwaways but played with discipline besides that.</p>
