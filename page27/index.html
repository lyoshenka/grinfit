    <p>The first of our regular midweek meetups. We warmed up with a bit of plyos and the give-n-go drill, then scrimmaged (5v5, then 3v3) for over an hour. It was a lot of fun. Playing with fewer players gives you way more touches and lets you feel like you&rsquo;re killing it on O because you&rsquo;re way open. On D though, its a lot tougher. I did ok for the most part. My cutting was pretty good but my deep throws were way off. Throwing higher has been helping, but now I&rsquo;m sometimes throwing too high. I guess that&rsquo;s ok for now.</p>

<p>After the game, we went to Luigi&rsquo;s Pizza in Fairmount and talked about jersey designs. I&rsquo;m starting to feel pretty good about it. They are not gonna wind up as boring as I feared.</p>

    <h2>Shuttles</h2>

<p>8 150yd shuttles (3x50yd) with the following rests: 50,75,90,120,75,90,50</p>

<p>Did them all in 23-24 seconds. Felt kinda slow on the last 20-40 yards of each, and my times are down two seconds from last shuttles workout.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>Then Bulb and I threw for about 20 min. My mid-range throws are coming along nicely but I still have a bad tendency to throw them too low. Need to aim higher, even if it seems weird to me. My deep throws were not great, prolly because I was tired and not very focused. Scoober is coming along nicely - need to not throw so far from my body and need to think about throwing it into a trash can.</p>

    <p>Great practice with AMP. I was a bit hurt so I didn&rsquo;t go 100% on everything, but I still played a decent amount. We worked on defense for the most part: deep D, under D, etc. There was a good amount of scrimmaging, which is always nice, and the drills were pretty fun and felt useful. Also my throwing on Friday definitely paid off because my throws were pretty good today (except when they were catastrophically bad). Especially in the away cut drill, my flicks finally had enough IO on them to stay straight in the wind. Unfortunately, it did not translate well to in-game hucks. I did have a really nice full-field huck to Diana, but it was just a bit too far :-(</p>

    <p>Another amp tryout, another injury. I think I strained my quad during warmups or the first drill or something. It feels very much like the time I messed up my right quad at OMK. But this time I&rsquo;m gonna take good care of it and not come back until I&rsquo;m ready. So I spent most of the practice watching the drills and the grames.</p>

    <p>Went to penn park with Diana to try out our new cleats and throw for a bit. We ended up picking up with some people who were playing there. The game was very low-level - no stalls, no calls, no real defense. But it was a great way to try out all the cleats I brought and it&rsquo;s always fun to run around and chase some plastic.</p>

    <p>Amp&rsquo;s first tournament of the season. I&rsquo;m still coming back from my tendonitis, so I only played half a day on Saturday. The weekend was a mix of ups and downs for me. I started off on a huge down, with two drops and three turns in our first game (which we ended up losing). The rest of the games went pretty well. We beat AG on Saturday, then won our quarters game on Sunday and lost a very close game to AG in semis. I caught a layout Callahan against AG.</p>

<p>Things I need to improve: cutting on O. My awareness is decent but needs work, especially paying attention to my teammates. I also need to learn to stop and cut faster and to throw better into the wind. Finally, fewer turns. Maybe it was just my first game outside, but the throwaways were poor decisions and that&rsquo;s no good.</p>

<p>EDIT: also got bit by a tick sometime this weekend. This might come in handy later.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been really lazy for the past two weeks: combination of rehabbing and being busy at work. So to get back in the habit, I&rsquo;m gonna start trying to work out in the morning. That way I&rsquo;ll make sure I&rsquo;m getting it done.</p>

<ul>
<li>10 pushups, 1 squat</li>
<li>9 pushups, 2 squats</li>
<li>etc</li>
<li>1 pushup, 10 squats</li>

<p>Total: 55 pushups, 55 squats</p>

<p>Time: 3:07</p>

<p>The time makes sense considering I can do 40 burpees in just over 2 minutes.</p>

We didn&rsquo;t have many subs, so I got to play a lot. Haverford has several players who are very strong, but they didn&rsquo;t move the disc too well and relied on being taller and more athletic.</p>

    <p>Great workout at Penn Park. We had at least 10 people. Did a bunch of things:</p>

<h2>Dynamic Warmups and Agility Ladder</h2>

<p>Various jumping, twisting stretches and speed ladder drills to warm up. Some throwing as well.</p>

<h2>10x80m Sprints on the Minute</h2>

<p>Start a clock. Every minute on the minute, sprint 80 meters. Spend the rest of the time walking back to the starting line.</p>

<p>This workout is supposed to be 100m, but we only had room for 80.</p>

<h2>Give and Go drill</h2>

<p>Ran the one side give-n-go drill a few times. There were 4 stationary players, and we ran by them giving and going with each. We did backhands in one direction, leftie backhands in the other. We did 4 or 5 reps of this.</p>

<h2>Short Cutting Box</h2>

<p>Set up a 10m box with a disc in the middle. Cut to the center, then out to a corner, then back to the center, then the next corner, etc. 3 reps of this.</p>

<h2>Defensive Footwork Drill</h2>

<p>Papa and I worked on our change of direction. We worked on making the right steps and on keeping our hips square with the cutter.</p>

<h2>Mini mini</h2>

<p>Played a very small mini game.</p>

<h2>Greek Lady supper club</h2>

<p>Milkshakes and gyros with everyone.</p>

<p>Threw with Papa for about 15 mintutes. The MLU discs really fly much straighter and are not as affected by the wind. I&rsquo;m sold.</p>

    <h2>Ultisquash</h2>

<p>The veteran&rsquo;s ultisquash fight club committee decided to honor Diana and me by inviting us to their elite game. In attendance: Wheels, Schmucker, TC, Panna, Dre, Raha, us. We played a dozen or so games, all intense and fast-paced. I really enjoyed playing with Schmucker and Wheels. They don&rsquo;t come out much and I don&rsquo;t get to play with them that often. Also covering TC was a lot of fun. What a great way to end the season.</p>

<h2>Spinners Practice</h2>

<p>I was rather sore after all that ultisquashing, but decided to go to Spinners practice anyway. The weather was finally nice and it&rsquo;s good to get my outdoor throws straight as early as possible. We spent a good amount of time on drills and working on some set plays, then scrimmaged a lot. We started our first set of scrimmages with a hunger-drill throw to simulate playing after a huck. I&rsquo;ve never done that before but I really like it. We also played a bunch of 2-minute make-it-take-it games and worked on double-teaming.</p>

<p>I was really tired by the time we started scrimmaging, and it didn&rsquo;t help that we had very few subs. I thought I played reasonably well and had some good throws and cuts, though I dropped the disc TWICE during the 4 lines cutting drill (where we were specifically trying not to drop the disc by focusing on catching one point of it) and also turfed an easy throw to DBaer because I didn&rsquo;t pivot.</p>
