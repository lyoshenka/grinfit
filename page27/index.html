    <p>I won the Green Jacket in my best game of frolf ever. I was -3 after 3 holes with a birdie on 1 and a mulligan-to-eagle on 3. I managed to maintain that score and par the rest of the holes, though it got hairy at times. I had a bit of a scare on 8 but managed to save par by sliding a scoober along the gravel and under a large bush. I could have even better if I didn&rsquo;t screw up the 7th and 8th holes (especially the 7th), and I was in great position to attempt a birdie on 9 but Steve convinced me to play it safe and take the win instead of trying to get fancy.</p>

    <p>Played 2 pretty crappy games in the hat tournament, then a decent current vs alum game (we won 15-6 I think), and then a really fun old-alums vs young-alums game (we won that 7-4). The last game was the most competitive and interesting. I&rsquo;d love to do that again next year.</p>

<p>I also finished 3rd overall in the skills competition and 2nd in longest pull.</p>

    <p>Lost to team AMP again. This time we were down a bit for most of the game, but came back at the end to bring it within one before losing 15-13. I didn&rsquo;t play my best game and we were all kinda ambivalent the whole time. After the game, we went out to Goat Hollow, which was pretty cool except for the loud guy playing guitar and singing.</p>

    <p>Two days of moshing around with Johnny Pivotfoot and the 10 Stallcounts. Made it to the finals this year, but couldn&rsquo;t close the deal. Probably not enough Pick 6s. I played a bunch, especially in the semis and finals on Sunday. I think my hucks and defense were my main issues, though I got a few good Ds and even had a nice box-out (though on O) that I&rsquo;m usually bad at. I was really impressed with Brown and Kristen. They played a lot and maintained a high level throughout. Dorko&rsquo;s defense was inspirational. Colin&rsquo;s scoobers were pretty and pinpoint. I missed Ross and Finkbot and Amy and Dusty. Kendra had one of the best Ds of the weekend. The tall-guys/short-girls line, the short-girls/tall-guys line and the Grant/Grin/Graham line all scored their point. Shelley fed us 40lbs of chicken. What more could I ask for.</p>

<p>Well, I could ask for fewer stupid turns. The one I threw way out the back on a huck to Kendra. The one that got Ded in the endzone because I rushed it. The bad bladey break to Shelley that should have been an IO backhand goal. The poor huck to Brown that could have easily been a goal. The dishie in the zone to Venose that should have gone to his other shoulder. The I-didnt-warm-up-enough turn to Kristen on the very first point on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The D I blinked on in the semis in the back corner of the endzone. The D on Zumba - just box him out. The one Dre threw right by my head. The IO huck I gave up first point of the finals, and the throw before that which I could have Ded if I reacted faster. The big upfield backhand that Alex broke me with - too much straightup. All the Pick 6s I forgot to run back.</p>

    <p>Fall league against the Penn State team (again). They were savage, we had 1 sub of each gender. We warmed up with Spikeball, then started playing. We took half 8-4 without feeling any real pressure. After half, they came zone. It was a bit windy, but mostly it was cold, and our throws were off. We let them score 5 breaks straight before we get our shit together and started playing like a real team. I think we won the game 15-11 or maybe 15-12. Finished with some more Spikeball before the lights went out.</p>

<blockquote><p>AMP&rsquo;s made progress again! Meeting physical ambitions, mastering planks and maneuvering past all Mid-Atlantic predicted adversaries, making postseason annual migration pattern.</p>

<p>Aggressive marking positions and magnificent plays are making people afraid. Meanwhile, Princess and Miggs [pseudonymns] are match-up problems, and Michael Panna a major pickup, adding more potent attacks. Mustached Purifico assaults molded plastic, Andrea&rsquo;s most passionate and Melissa&rsquo;s perfect at motivating players. Adept Melanie preserves AMP&rsquo;s major possessions, and Maddie, Pelleg and Matt Paparone are massive performers. Alex&rsquo;s mammoth pulls and magical point-blocks always mystify people.</p>

<p>Allowing momentary pause, all members prepare and meticulously plan a merciless push. After mental preparation and much practicing, another mighty pool awaits mixed Philadelphians. AMP&rsquo;s mission plan: attack, make plays, achieve maximum pleasure and modern prominence.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Nationals this year was very fun and also somewhat disappointing. We did not achieve our goal of making semis and most likely failed to qualify for Worlds. However, we played well most of the time and had some great games (especially vs. Slow White in pre-quarters). Personally I&rsquo;m happy with how I played. I didn&rsquo;t get much PT on Thursday, but played a lot on Friday. I got equal time on the O line and the D line, which is a first for me since college. I only had 2 turns (one less than last Nationals), though they were both in our most important game (quarters vs. Wildcard). I also didn&rsquo;t have any solid Ds (one got caught by a different player, another was really a drop by the O guy and not my D). Despite being -2 on my scale, I think my game was solid and I did the right thing most of the time.</p>

<p>The main things I need to work on are still throws, speed, and anticipation on D.</p>

    <p>Had a fairly light practice. We worked on several play calls, did a few pull play scrimmages and some transition work, worked on our redzone O and our marks, scrimmaged and threw deep in the wind. I played with the O line again so I&rsquo;ll be ready to fill in on O when needed. I had some unusually bad turns on O, including a drop on a wide-open pass. D was better - definitely feeling faster after the last two weeks of easier and more consistent workouts. Looking forward to one last high-intensity workout on Monday or Tuesday to seal the deal.</p>

    <p>Scrimmaged a few friends of the team. We played several games to 8 or to 5 on a slightly short field. I ended up playing a good amount of D and O. Played pretty well on both, but had two turns (one bad throw, one D on a dishy) and a risky throw that I probably should not have taken. Gotta have more discipline when someone calls for it.</p>

    <p>Good practice. I played with the O line this time, which was a nice change for me. I think I did well overall. My spacing and timing wasn&rsquo;t as great as it could have been, and I threw my only turn of the day on a wide-open cut to Alex. I put too much edge on the disc and it dropped right at his feet. I also did well in the redzone scrimmge and the upline drill. On D, I played tight on my guy but got beat deep once or twice and wasn&rsquo;t as decisive in the zone as I should have been (pick one side and commit, don&rsquo;t hang out in the middle).</p>
