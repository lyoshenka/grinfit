    <p>4 hours of practice at Ballfields. I played offense most of the time, which was a nice change. I think I played pretty well, though I had two back-to-back turnovers that should have both been easy goals. Besides that, I did a reasonably good job cutting, throwing and scoring. Raha even said she felt I played well.</p>

<p>I think the O line won one double-score scrimmage out of three (though we won it 4-0) and also won the first red zone to 10.</p>

    <p>Tonight was the first game of Competitive Fall League. Cotton Mouth&#8482; represented well. We were a bit short on players (7 guys, 5 girls) but we came out strong and closed stronger. Penn State let us go up two breaks right off the bat, then got em back to take half 8-7. We started the half with three straight breaks and then got three or four in a row to win the game 15-11. I expected more of a fight from the other team, but this makes me optimistic about the season.</p>

<p>Katie and I also did a bunch of AMPs during the game and I did a few more at home to bring it up to 50.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A fun and useful weekend of practices, beach play and hanging out. The schedule:</p>

<p>Friday night: fishbowl charades game.</p>

<p>Saturday morning: Grass practice. We worked on dumps to the open side, then redzone offense, then scrimmage. My ankle held up pretty well throughout, though its not 100% yet. Offense won the first scrimmage, defense won the second.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon: Beach practice. Playing in the wind and on the sand was great. We did a breakmark drill and the Petter drill. The wind really added a new level of difficulty. Then we split into 3 teams and played a round-robin tournament with the non-playing team doing Jamals, agility and throwing drills while the other teams played 4 on 4.</p>

<p>Sunday night: pool, grilling, crossdressing, psychiatrist, football via Apple TV.</p>

<p>Sunday morning: Back to grass. Did a Jackpot drill for vert stack and ho stack, then a bunch of O vs D scrimmaging, then a breakmark throwing/marking drill, and one final scrimmage. I started doing drills but sat out for all of the scrimmages at first. Then I got back in for the second drill and played the last game to 5. My ankle still needs time off. Major icing and ibu still needed. Also got my captain feedback: I need to get faster.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon: more pool, hoagies, Space Jam.</p>

    <p>Had a pretty good Amp turnout at Penn Park tonight. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to do much except throw and do pushups, but my ankle held up pretty well. I did most of the agility drills (T-drill, sprint-and-backpedal-in-a-box drill) but stopped towards the end. Insted I ran several 40yd sprints, working on looking for the disc and then putting my head down to run.</p>

<p>After the agility work, we switched to the hunger drill. I could do that fine because its just running in a straight line, though my ankle was not happy towards the end. We finished with 25 AMPs and some more throwing.</p>

    <p>Amp practice 9am-1pm. I rolled my ankle at about 9:30, so I spent most of the time watching and icing. It was a good practice.

Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be ready by Wednesday.</p>

<p>Did 50 AMPs throughout the day and then 20 more with everyone at the end.</p>

    <p>A great weekend for ultimate. The weather was perfect, our team was underrated, and we were poised to ruin some dreams. Our first game was Saturday afternoon against Bill and Stacy. We didn&rsquo;t come out strong, but victory was rarely in question. We kept it close through most of the game before pulling away to win 15-11. This put us in E pool and set up the long-awaited Vinny vs. Flagger matchup (on the showcase field, no less). Both teams were fairly drunk at this point, though Diana was actually sobering up after a very sloppy Game 1 BAC level. Turns out we play better when we&rsquo;re drunk (and when Ellis is there). I think we were up the whole game and won by a lot. I played one point with two giant cardboard hands taped to my hands, and Diana threw me the goal. Our victory put is in E pool semis, the first time I&rsquo;ve ever played on Sunday of Finals. Diana and I both finished the day at +2.</p>

<p>Our first game on Sunday was against Butter and Raha&rsquo;s team. We were even more shorthanded than yesterday: only 5 guys. Our opponents went 5-2 on offense every time, so by the end of the game we were feeling pretty gassed. The game was close throughout though I think we led for pretty much the whole time. We won 15-13. Wolf and Max both had a stellar game. Wolf must have caught at least half of our goals and Max threw some beautiful long shots to him and others. Ben also played extremely well, with two spectacular layouts to maintain posession after crappy throws. Tired but undefeated, we moved on into E pool finals against Vanni, Harrison and their squad. Our lack of subs really showed this game. We quickly went down 0-4 and continued to struggle the whole game. The finals score was 15-7 bad guys, but we put up a fight to the very end. I had two layout Ds (my only layouts of the weekend) and a good long huck to Max. Diana threw me a nice huck for a goal, and Max continued to play excellent defense. I&rsquo;m not gonna talk about how many terrible decisions and throws I had because there were too many to remember.</p>

<p>Despite our loss in the finals, I had a lot of fun. I played every point except one in both games on Sunday, and I played almost all of the points on Saturday until we started killing it in game 2. Now that ultimate is done for a month or so, it&rsquo;s time to focus 100% on Amp.</p>

    <p>Another close and well-fought game at Mercer. We came out strong with a big focus on defense and jumped out to an early lead. We got five breaks in the first half, going up 8-4. But in the second half, our offense let us down. We threw away easy throws and dropped a couple of discs, letting PTA back in the game. We got some nice Ds back, but could not convert. We ended up losing 17-15.</p>

<p>After the game, we hung out, drank some beer, and played a bunch of Milk.</p>

    <p>I missed game 1 on Monday and we lost by 2 points, so this was a do-or-die situation for us. I don&rsquo;t think we played the best that we could, but we did win 15-13. Tache, Swilson and Franky each had a few nice Ds. Jack had a sick layout D but it was a foul. I covered Frecka for the most part, so I didn&rsquo;t really have many chances at a D, but I did contain him on all but one occaision (when he beat me deep right at the start of the point). I also threw away a disc on a rushed swing to Swilson. Need to stop rushing my throws.</p>

<p>Game 3 tomorrow FTW.</p>

    <p>Played our last regular season tournament: ECC in Seattle. We finished 3rd and played pretty well most of the time, but had too many unforced turns in the semis against Wildcard. I made good progress on my defensive focus, especially in that game, but still had two poor throwing decisions and did not play at 100% on every single point. I&rsquo;d give myself an 8 out of 10 for the weekend.</p>

<p>Stats for the weekend: 6 goals, 2 assists, 3 throwaways (though I consider one to be only 50% my fault), 3 Ds.</p>

<p>Most of the team stayed until Monday night and spent Monday hanging out in Seattle. I really liked the city. It&rsquo;s very green and close to nature. There&rsquo;s water everywhere. It really reminds me of Portland, Maine. I know I&rsquo;m a bit biased because the weather was nice (not rainy like it often is) and I spent most of the day doing fun stuff. But still, I&rsquo;d live there.</p>

    <p>Went to Melissa Witmer&rsquo;s agility clinc at Edgely. It was focused very much on the hips and glutes. We started with a three-part warmup: moderate-speed longer-distance stuff to get our heart rate up, then dynamic stretching, then high-speed stuff to get our nervous system ready for full intensity. The last part was pretty new to me. It was very short-distance (15 yards max). The exercises were similar to what I&rsquo;m used to (carioca, shuffles, butt kicks, skips, etc), but the focus is on speed and explosiveness.</p>

<p>After that, we moved into the drills. There were several drills: jab step, jazz step (jab step with the inside leg), 5-10-5 cone sprints and plyo cone jumps for minimum ground contact. The emphasis was again on the hips: which way they are facing, internal vs external rotation, full range of motion and turning the hips correctly in anticipation of a change of direction.</p>

<p>After the last drill, we played 4-on-4 mini till it got dark.</p>

    <p>Did some Kung Fu Throwing in the park. Ellis and I modified the workout a bit, but it was basically the same thing. Also did 60 jump squats (x2 because of the focused throwing) and 50 pushups during the workout.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Played our first summer league playoffs game. We played pretty awful. We were missing a lot of people (draft picks 3,4,5,7,8,9) and we didn&rsquo;t have the personnel to match up with Alex Peters' team. He had a bunch of tall people and a bunch of fast people, and we were pretty short and not great on D. Some points, we played well, but we didn&rsquo;t really have a shot at winning without our full team. It was not a fun game (for me).</p>

<p>After the game, I did 50 pushups for losing to Diana in Ds-Turns. Then our team hung out and played Kings while drinking beer and run-nanas. Looking forward to crushing it in E-F pool.</p>
