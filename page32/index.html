    <p>A great weekend for ultimate. The weather was perfect, our team was underrated, and we were poised to ruin some dreams. Our first game was Saturday afternoon against Bill and Stacy. We didn&rsquo;t come out strong, but victory was rarely in question. We kept it close through most of the game before pulling away to win 15-11. This put us in E pool and set up the long-awaited Vinny vs. Flagger matchup (on the showcase field, no less). Both teams were fairly drunk at this point, though Diana was actually sobering up after a very sloppy Game 1 BAC level. Turns out we play better when we&rsquo;re drunk (and when Ellis is there). I think we were up the whole game and won by a lot. I played one point with two giant cardboard hands taped to my hands, and Diana threw me the goal. Our victory put is in E pool semis, the first time I&rsquo;ve ever played on Sunday of Finals. Diana and I both finished the day at +2.</p>

<p>Our first game on Sunday was against Butter and Raha&rsquo;s team. We were even more shorthanded than yesterday: only 5 guys. Our opponents went 5-2 on offense every time, so by the end of the game we were feeling pretty gassed. The game was close throughout though I think we led for pretty much the whole time. We won 15-13. Wolf and Max both had a stellar game. Wolf must have caught at least half of our goals and Max threw some beautiful long shots to him and others. Ben also played extremely well, with two spectacular layouts to maintain posession after crappy throws. Tired but undefeated, we moved on into E pool finals against Vanni, Harrison and their squad. Our lack of subs really showed this game. We quickly went down 0-4 and continued to struggle the whole game. The finals score was 15-7 bad guys, but we put up a fight to the very end. I had two layout Ds (my only layouts of the weekend) and a good long huck to Max. Diana threw me a nice huck for a goal, and Max continued to play excellent defense. I&rsquo;m not gonna talk about how many terrible decisions and throws I had because there were too many to remember.</p>

<p>Despite our loss in the finals, I had a lot of fun. I played every point except one in both games on Sunday, and I played almost all of the points on Saturday until we started killing it in game 2. Now that ultimate is done for a month or so, it&rsquo;s time to focus 100% on Amp.</p>

    <p>Another close and well-fought game at Mercer. We came out strong with a big focus on defense and jumped out to an early lead. We got five breaks in the first half, going up 8-4. But in the second half, our offense let us down. We threw away easy throws and dropped a couple of discs, letting PTA back in the game. We got some nice Ds back, but could not convert. We ended up losing 17-15.</p>

<p>After the game, we hung out, drank some beer, and played a bunch of Milk.</p>

    <p>I missed game 1 on Monday and we lost by 2 points, so this was a do-or-die situation for us. I don&rsquo;t think we played the best that we could, but we did win 15-13. Tache, Swilson and Franky each had a few nice Ds. Jack had a sick layout D but it was a foul. I covered Frecka for the most part, so I didn&rsquo;t really have many chances at a D, but I did contain him on all but one occaision (when he beat me deep right at the start of the point). I also threw away a disc on a rushed swing to Swilson. Need to stop rushing my throws.</p>

<p>Game 3 tomorrow FTW.</p>

    <p>Played our last regular season tournament: ECC in Seattle. We finished 3rd and played pretty well most of the time, but had too many unforced turns in the semis against Wildcard. I made good progress on my defensive focus, especially in that game, but still had two poor throwing decisions and did not play at 100% on every single point. I&rsquo;d give myself an 8 out of 10 for the weekend.</p>

<p>Stats for the weekend: 6 goals, 2 assists, 3 throwaways (though I consider one to be only 50% my fault), 3 Ds.</p>

<p>Most of the team stayed until Monday night and spent Monday hanging out in Seattle. I really liked the city. It&rsquo;s very green and close to nature. There&rsquo;s water everywhere. It really reminds me of Portland, Maine. I know I&rsquo;m a bit biased because the weather was nice (not rainy like it often is) and I spent most of the day doing fun stuff. But still, I&rsquo;d live there.</p>

    <p>Went to Melissa Witmer&rsquo;s agility clinc at Edgely. It was focused very much on the hips and glutes. We started with a three-part warmup: moderate-speed longer-distance stuff to get our heart rate up, then dynamic stretching, then high-speed stuff to get our nervous system ready for full intensity. The last part was pretty new to me. It was very short-distance (15 yards max). The exercises were similar to what I&rsquo;m used to (carioca, shuffles, butt kicks, skips, etc), but the focus is on speed and explosiveness.</p>

<p>After that, we moved into the drills. There were several drills: jab step, jazz step (jab step with the inside leg), 5-10-5 cone sprints and plyo cone jumps for minimum ground contact. The emphasis was again on the hips: which way they are facing, internal vs external rotation, full range of motion and turning the hips correctly in anticipation of a change of direction.</p>

<p>After the last drill, we played 4-on-4 mini till it got dark.</p>

    <p>Played our first summer league playoffs game. We played pretty awful. We were missing a lot of people (draft picks 3,4,5,7,8,9) and we didn&rsquo;t have the personnel to match up with Alex Peters' team. He had a bunch of tall people and a bunch of fast people, and we were pretty short and not great on D. Some points, we played well, but we didn&rsquo;t really have a shot at winning without our full team. It was not a fun game (for me).</p>

<p>After the game, I did 50 pushups for losing to Diana in Ds-Turns. Then our team hung out and played Kings while drinking beer and run-nanas. Looking forward to crushing it in E-F pool.</p>

    <p>Won Chesapeake Open yesterday. The competition was pretty weak, so we only played one team that really challenged us. That was Termite&rsquo;s Entourage, whom we played in the finals. The weather was pretty windy and we failed to score many break opportunities. Some points, we would get 3 or 4 or 5 Ds but fail to convert them. We ended up winning the game 12-11 but we did not play our system well. I had two throwaways on wide-open throws that I rushed, including one in our last D point immediately after getting the D.</p>

<p>According to my own accounting, I finished the weekend with a D&rsquo;s-Turns score of 0 (don&rsquo;t remember if it was 3 of each or 4 of each).</p>

<p>On the plus side, I caught at least 7 goals on the weekend and threw 3 more. Diana threw me 3 of those goals, including one that I caught on a chest-high fully-outstretched layout. How&rsquo;s that for a birthday present.</p>

<p>After the game, we (Diana, Birdo, Devlin and I) ran the 10-cut shuttle drill 4 times. On the last time, Birdo and I threw a disc to each other at each cone.</p>

    <p>Played our first USAU Triple Crown event - the Philly Invite. The top teams in the country were in attendance - teams 5-16 from nationals last year. This was our first weekend as a full team with a finalized roster, and we stepped up our game bigtime. We took second in our pool with a 4-1 record (beating Odyssee, Mental Toss, Slow White and 7 Figures, and losing to CLX), which put us in the championship bracket. In semis, we took down Ghosts on a universe point goal. Then in finals, we avenged our loss to CLX and won first place. On the whole, everyone played very well. Birdo and Papa especially stood out for low turnovers, a lot of Ds, tons of goals (Birdo) and strong play against tough matchups (Papa vs Stout). Personally I played ok, but I had too many turnovers (even though Butter said some of them were good turns) and was not feeling 100% strong on Saturday (don&rsquo;t know if it was the heat or my 2 weeks in Africa).</p>

<p>Firsts:</p>

<ul>
<li>My first real club tournament win ever.</li>
<li>AMP&rsquo;s first tourney win since 2009.</li>
<li>First time AMP beat Slow White and Ghosts (at least the first time since I started playing with AMP).</li>
<li>My first between-the-legs goal (against Todd Herman - game winner vs Slow White).</li>
<li>First time in many years that I seriously cramped up while playing - both calves, right shin, right bicep.</li>

  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Spent two weeks in Tanzania. The first week, we hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro. Most of the hike was pretty easy and we were pampered quite a bit. I felt like a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lyoshenka/9318771865">British explorer</a> - having a tea break before dinner and being around green canvas tents all the time. The summit night, however, was the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done in my life. We woke up at midnight, ate a small meal, and spent the next six and a half hours getting to the top. It was dark, cold (below 0F) and there wasn&rsquo;t much oxygen. I felt fine at the start (4800m above sea level) but after a few hours, walking became pretty difficult. The cold didn&rsquo;t bother me as much, but the lack of oxygen was rough. I spent most of the second half of the climb just focusing on walking slowly. I was mentally repeating &ldquo;left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot&rdquo; to keep focused. As we neared the first summit (Stella Point), the sun started to rise. When I got there, it was glorious. I was (almost) at the roof of Africa. We took a short break to drink some tea with sugar, then continued on to the real summit (Uhuru Peak), which was over an hour away and 200m higher. This section was not as bad as getting to Stella Point because it was warmer, less steep and the end was in sight. At the peak, we took another short break and a bunch of pictures (including a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lyoshenka/9318842727">mandatory handstand pic</a> for me). Then we started our descent. Back at Stella Point, we took a few more pictures before heading back to camp. The descent took about an hour and a half. Then we slept for a bit, ate a little and went down another few hundred meters to a lower camp to make sure we don&rsquo;t get altitude sickness.</p>

    <p>Played a short game in the rain. Edgely was swamped so we moved to the Belmont Plateau fields. Ended up only playing to 9 because it got dark. It was very rainy and wet, so throwing and catching was tough for everyone. Gloves would definitely have helped, especially because our deep game was lacking. I threw several good backhand hucks but every flick huck attempt slipped out of my hand and fluttered to the ground. The game was close the whole way through, but Ditz&rsquo;s team scored a late break to go up 8-7 and &ldquo;take half&rdquo;, so they received again and scored that to win 9-7.</p>

<p>Afterwards Vinny, Jean and I ran some shuffle-sprints. We did 8 total: 4 normal ones and 4 out-in-alltheway. We drank beer and ate carnitas and stayed up till 3am.</p>

    <p>Played a few games to 5 at the Duck Pond before the thunderstorm kicked us off. Spinners season is done, so all those guys came out. Also a new girl named Claire. The games were good but the weather was really muggy, so it was kinda rough.</p>

    <p>4 hours of practice at Edgely. We spent a lot of time scrimmaging with a focus on defense. We tried several poachy defenses, different marks and downfield positioning. We also spent a little time on reading/catching hucks and throwing deep to women. My defense was not the best and I turned over a wide-open away throw to a girl. I was better on offense: cutting was pretty smooth and I threw a nice huck. Need to work on fitness and quickness more.</p>
