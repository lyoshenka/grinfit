    <p>Ran 6 150m shuttles with Butter and Sara. First 3 were a 50m course, last 3 were 25m course. I ran the 50m ones in about 24-25s each. The 25m ones were
27-28s each. We also warmed up by jogging the circumference of the field twice. We did long strides for the long edges and slow jog for the short edges.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Sara and I joined the Penn pickup crew and played ultimate for a while. She left early, I stuck around till the end. There were a few new
girls there. Two were high schoolers and one just moved to the area. One of the high schoolers had a cannon flick for her age, and the other was a good
deep cutter and receiver. Pretty sure Butter’s recruiting them for his indoor team.</p>

    <p>I’d taken the whole week off before last practice, and took Monday off as well to make sure my knee was 100%. But I couldn’t keep doing nothing, so I came
out for the last workout to do some shuttles, shuffles and throwing. We took forever finding a place to run because most fields were busy with intramurals
or other team practice. Eventually we ran 4 shuttles and 4 shuffles, then threw till the IM ultimate game kicked us off.</p>

<p>We threw between most of the shuttles. Then after we were done, we worked on throwing a dishy and cutting deep for the huck. We did that a few times with and into the wind, but only caught about half the hucks. The rest were either overthrown (with the wind) or just bad throws. After cutting for hucks, we just worked on our deep throws. My backhands are decent but my flicks are still awful.</p>

    <p>We were supposed to scrimmage at Penn Park for two hours, but they shut the lights off after about 30 minutes of playing. So we worked on our deep hucks in the dark instead. The cutting practice (the shape, the turn, not slowing down while looking back) was great. The throwing part would have been great but I was rushed to throw the next throw and not being able to see your throw was really weird.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I did the shuffles workout:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4x10secondsx5yards side shuffle with crossover on the first step out of the turn</li>
  <li>2x10cut drill, again with crossover on the first step</li>

<h2 id="throwing">Throwing</h2>

<p>Spent about 10 minutes working on my throws. Primarily worked on the full-extension backhand fake to the flick throw. I have trouble getting power when coming all the way back from a full step-out. Watching Melanie throw, I noticed that she doesn’t pivot the full 180 degrees on the way back. She goes about 135, with her right foot out in front of her left. That seemed to help, will try it next time. Also, gotta throw the disc more up and IO when reaching far or pivoting hard.</p>

    <p>An hour of 3-on-3 with the South/West Philly Amp crew. We did 3 minutes on, 3 minutes off. The weather was really hot and the turf at Penn Park made it even hotter, so the pace of the game was not the highest. Still, it was good practice. My throws and cuts were somewhat lazy at times, but other times I played strong D and cut well. I did have a few bad turnovers, still not focusing on my decisions enough.</p>

<p>After mini, I did this week’s shuffles (8x10secondsx5yards, 30seconds rest inbetween) with Bulb and Diana. I focused on staying light on my feet in the middle and exploding out of the plants at the ends.</p>

<p>150 seconds rest between each rep. We threw during some of the rests but forgot during others.</p>

<h2 id="throwing">Throwing</h2>

<p>Mel showed up during the end of our shuttles and we threw for about 15 min. I worked on my flick throws - trying to get them smooth, flat and high enough.</p>

<ul>
  <li>4x10m shuffles with 15 seconds on, 45 seconds rest</li>

    <p>Second workout of the day. I skipped out on most of the sprints, shuttles and hill sprints because I lifted earlier. Instead I threw with Gabe and Maddie. Then I worked on defensive positioning and threw some more.</p>

<p>For the record, here’s the workout:</p>

<h2 id="20m-sprints">20m Sprints</h2>

<p>Do a bunch of 20m sprints with different starts. Start facing different directions, loading one leg or the other, leaning forwards, stepping backwards, etc. My favorite was to set up as if you’re covering someone in the stack and have them cut in while you chase. If the defender beats the cutter to the line, they win a prize (in this case, a chicken wing). Rest for full recovery between sprints.</p>

<p>I skipped everything but the O-D sprints.</p>

<h2 id="shuttles">Shuttles</h2>

<p>Sprint 50m, do 5 side-to-side shuffles between two cones, sprint 50m, shuffle again, sprint 50m. Not sure what the rest is, I’d do 1-2min.</p>

<h2 id="hill-sprints">Hill Sprints</h2>

<p>I didn’t see what they did because I was throwing, but I did discover that Penn Park has some nice short hills to sprint up.</p>

<h2 id="defense-drill">Defense Drill</h2>

<p>Did Nick’s box drill several times. Worked on focusing on my defenders hips, staying close to them and being on the correct side of them. Also on my footwork. Papa pointed out that on Amp, we tend to spend a lot of time watching the disc when our person is not active. That’s important, but we should be spending more time watching our person and only glancing at the disc momentarily to get an idea of what’s going on. This will let us react faster to our person making a move, and we’ll be closer on the D.</p>

    <p>Did basically the same throwing routine as yesterday, but only on the backhand side. We also didn’t play defense on the cuts because it’s not that useful and you just get tired. Instead we tried not to slow down our cuts so that the thrower has a real idea of whether they timed their throw well.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I returned to FitGym after a two-year hiatus at the Pumpatorium. They’ve added a few new things - non-bent bars and a new squat cage, plus a kettlebell area upstairs. I started off easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deadlift: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>@<span class="number">135</span>/<span class="number">135</span>/<span class="number">185</span> </span></li>
  <li>Press: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>@<span class="number">65</span>/<span class="number">85</span>/<span class="number">85</span> </span></li>
  <li>Pullups: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>/<span class="number">4</span>/<span class="number">3</span>@<span class="number">25</span> </span></li>
  <li>Box jumps: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>@<span class="number">24</span>/<span class="number">24</span>/<span class="number">30</span> inches </span></li>
</ul>

<p>After the gym, we went to Penn Park and worked on our around throws. We practiced throwing goals into the endzone and used a mini soccer goal as a mark. We simulated a flat mark, 30 degree mark and 45 degree mark, and challenged ourselves to step out far to make the throw. The cuts were about 80% speed, but had a trailing defender to ensure that the throw is timed well and on-target. We did backhands first, then flicks. At the end, we threw hucks for a bit.</p>

    <p>3 sets of 4-5 reps of exercises and sprints. One rep is this:</p>

  <li>do 10-20 reps of an exercise</li>

  <li>rest while your partner does what you just did</li>

<p>We did 5 reps the first two times, then cut it down to 4 for the last set. Our erexcises were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 3-yard lateral shuffles</li>
  <li>20 seconds moving plank</li>
  <li>20 scissor jumps</li>
  <li>15 full-body situps</li>
  <li>20 squats (skipped these on the last set)</li>
</ul>

<p>We took about 5 min between each set to rest and do some focused throwing. We also threw for about 15 min afterwards. I worked on tired throwing and also on my leftie roaster throw. Dan pointed out that I should try to throw it inside out because that how I’d probably use it in a game.</p>

<p>Did them all in 23-24 seconds. Felt kinda slow on the last 20-40 yards of each, and my times are down two seconds from last shuttles workout.</p>

<h2 id="throwing">Throwing</h2>

<p>Then Bulb and I threw for about 20 min. My mid-range throws are coming along nicely but I still have a bad tendency to throw them too low. Need to aim higher, even if it seems weird to me. My deep throws were not great, prolly because I was tired and not very focused. Scoober is coming along nicely - need to not throw so far from my body and need to think about throwing it into a trash can.</p>

    <p>Great workout at Penn Park. We had at least 10 people. Did a bunch of things:</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-warmups-and-agility-ladder">Dynamic Warmups and Agility Ladder</h2>

<p>Various jumping, twisting stretches and speed ladder drills to warm up. Some throwing as well.</p>

<h2 id="10x80m-sprints-on-the-minute">10x80m Sprints on the Minute</h2>

<p>Start a clock. Every minute on the minute, sprint 80 meters. Spend the rest of the time walking back to the starting line.</p>

<p>This workout is supposed to be 100m, but we only had room for 80.</p>

<h2 id="give-and-go-drill">Give and Go drill</h2>

<p>Ran the one side give-n-go drill a few times. There were 4 stationary players, and we ran by them giving and going with each. We did backhands in one direction, leftie backhands in the other. We did 4 or 5 reps of this.</p>

<h2 id="short-cutting-box">Short Cutting Box</h2>

<p>Set up a 10m box with a disc in the middle. Cut to the center, then out to a corner, then back to the center, then the next corner, etc. 3 reps of this.</p>

<h2 id="defensive-footwork-drill">Defensive Footwork Drill</h2>

<p>Papa and I worked on our change of direction. We worked on making the right steps and on keeping our hips square with the cutter.</p>

<h2 id="mini-mini">Mini mini</h2>

<p>Played a very small mini game.</p>

<h2 id="greek-lady-supper-club">Greek Lady supper club</h2>

<p>Milkshakes and gyros with everyone.</p>
