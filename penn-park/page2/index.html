    <p>Second workout of the day. I skipped out on most of the sprints, shuttles and hill sprints because I lifted earlier. Instead I threw with Gabe and Maddie. Then I worked on defensive positioning and threw some more.</p>

<p>For the record, here&rsquo;s the workout:</p>

<h2>20m Sprints</h2>

<p>Do a bunch of 20m sprints with different starts. Start facing different directions, loading one leg or the other, leaning forwards, stepping backwards, etc. My favorite was to set up as if you&rsquo;re covering someone in the stack and have them cut in while you chase. If the defender beats the cutter to the line, they win a prize (in this case, a chicken wing). Rest for full recovery between sprints.</p>

<p>I skipped everything but the O-D sprints.</p>

<h2>Shuttles</h2>

<p>Sprint 50m, do 5 side-to-side shuffles between two cones, sprint 50m, shuffle again, sprint 50m. Not sure what the rest is, I&rsquo;d do 1-2min.</p>

<h2>Hill Sprints</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t see what they did because I was throwing, but I did discover that Penn Park has some nice short hills to sprint up.</p>

<h2>Defense Drill</h2>

<p>Did Nick&rsquo;s box drill several times. Worked on focusing on my defenders hips, staying close to them and being on the correct side of them. Also on my footwork. Papa pointed out that on Amp, we tend to spend a lot of time watching the disc when our person is not active. That&rsquo;s important, but we should be spending more time watching our person and only glancing at the disc momentarily to get an idea of what&rsquo;s going on. This will let us react faster to our person making a move, and we&rsquo;ll be closer on the D.</p>

    <p>Did basically the same throwing routine as yesterday, but only on the backhand side. We also didn&rsquo;t play defense on the cuts because it&rsquo;s not that useful and you just get tired. Instead we tried not to slow down our cuts so that the thrower has a real idea of whether they timed their throw well.</p>

  </h1>
  <div class="content js-start-hidden" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I returned to FitGym after a two-year hiatus at the Pumpatorium. They&rsquo;ve added a few new things - non-bent bars and a new squat cage, plus a kettlebell area upstairs. I started off easy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deadlift: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>@<span class="number">135</span>/<span class="number">135</span>/<span class="number">185</span> </span></li>
<li>Press: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>@<span class="number">65</span>/<span class="number">85</span>/<span class="number">85</span> </span></li>
<li>Pullups: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>/<span class="number">4</span>/<span class="number">3</span>@<span class="number">25</span> </span></li>
<li>Box jumps: <span class="workout-unit"><span class="number">5</span>@<span class="number">24</span>/<span class="number">24</span>/<span class="number">30</span> inches </span></li>
</ul>


<p>After the gym, we went to Penn Park and worked on our around throws. We practiced throwing goals into the endzone and used a mini soccer goal as a mark. We simulated a flat mark, 30 degree mark and 45 degree mark, and challenged ourselves to step out far to make the throw. The cuts were about 80% speed, but had a trailing defender to ensure that the throw is timed well and on-target. We did backhands first, then flicks. At the end, we threw hucks for a bit.</p>

    <p>3 sets of 4-5 reps of exercises and sprints. One rep is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>do 10-20 reps of an exercise</li>
<li>sprint from the start to the 25yd line, then back to the 15yd line, then to the 40</li>
<li>rest while your partner does what you just did</li>
</ul>


<p>We did 5 reps the first two times, then cut it down to 4 for the last set. Our erexcises were:</p>

<ul>
<li>20 3-yard lateral shuffles</li>
<li>20 seconds moving plank</li>
<li>20 scissor jumps</li>
<li>15 full-body situps</li>
<li>20 squats (skipped these on the last set)</li>
</ul>


<p>We took about 5 min between each set to rest and do some focused throwing. We also threw for about 15 min afterwards. I worked on tired throwing and also on my leftie roaster throw. Dan pointed out that I should try to throw it inside out because that how I&rsquo;d probably use it in a game.</p>

    <h2>Shuttles</h2>

<p>8 150yd shuttles (3x50yd) with the following rests: 50,75,90,120,75,90,50</p>

<p>Did them all in 23-24 seconds. Felt kinda slow on the last 20-40 yards of each, and my times are down two seconds from last shuttles workout.</p>

<h2>Throwing</h2>

<p>Then Bulb and I threw for about 20 min. My mid-range throws are coming along nicely but I still have a bad tendency to throw them too low. Need to aim higher, even if it seems weird to me. My deep throws were not great, prolly because I was tired and not very focused. Scoober is coming along nicely - need to not throw so far from my body and need to think about throwing it into a trash can.</p>

    <p>Went to penn park with Diana to try out our new cleats and throw for a bit. We ended up picking up with some people who were playing there. The game was very low-level - no stalls, no calls, no real defense. But it was a great way to try out all the cleats I brought and it&rsquo;s always fun to run around and chase some plastic.</p>

    <p>Great workout at Penn Park. We had at least 10 people. Did a bunch of things:</p>

<h2>Dynamic Warmups and Agility Ladder</h2>

<p>Various jumping, twisting stretches and speed ladder drills to warm up. Some throwing as well.</p>

<h2>10x80m Sprints on the Minute</h2>

<p>Start a clock. Every minute on the minute, sprint 80 meters. Spend the rest of the time walking back to the starting line.</p>

<p>This workout is supposed to be 100m, but we only had room for 80.</p>

<h2>Give and Go drill</h2>

<p>Ran the one side give-n-go drill a few times. There were 4 stationary players, and we ran by them giving and going with each. We did backhands in one direction, leftie backhands in the other. We did 4 or 5 reps of this.</p>

<h2>Short Cutting Box</h2>

<p>Set up a 10m box with a disc in the middle. Cut to the center, then out to a corner, then back to the center, then the next corner, etc. 3 reps of this.</p>

<h2>Defensive Footwork Drill</h2>

<p>Papa and I worked on our change of direction. We worked on making the right steps and on keeping our hips square with the cutter.</p>

<h2>Mini mini</h2>

<p>Played a very small mini game.</p>

<h2>Greek Lady supper club</h2>

<p>Milkshakes and gyros with everyone.</p>
