    <p>Another year, another nationals. This year it was back in Sarasota. The weather was hot, but the location is the best - the fields were
beautiful, the ocean was amazing (even at night, and even despite the jellyfish), and the Daquiri Deck was even better than I remember it.
The only thing lacking was our game. We lost all our games on Thursday (9-12 Blackbird, 11-12 AMP, 11-12 Toro), then won the next 4 games
and clawed our way back into the top 8 before losing the 7/8 game to Drag'n Thrust (13-10 Love Tractor, 14-11 Steamboat, 12-11 Blackbird,
15-9 shame, 9-15 Drag'n). So, no finals appearance this year, but we did win the spirit award, which is almost as big.</p>

<p>Personally I played fairly well. I was only in 2-4 points a game, so I was fresh overall. I had 3 turns total - a drop against AMP and two
throwaways on hucks. Both were good decisions, decently well-thrown, and just a little off the mark. We talked about taking calculated
risks, so I stand by them. I scored 5 goals, threw one, and got a D. I felt I could have contributed more, esp filling in as an O line
cutter when our O was tired (like the last game on Thurs), but we ran a fairly tight rotation so I did my best to help from the sideline.</p>

<p>Another nationals highlight was watching AMP make it to the finals for the first time ever. They played really well, but ended up losing on
universe to Mixtape in a very exciting game. Despite that, I&rsquo;m really happy for them. Their team is very young and they&rsquo;ll be strong for a
few years at least (if they stick together).</p>

<p>Finally, the best part (as always) is spending time with people you know and like. I had a great time bonding with the team (chai time,
skinny dipping every night, getting kicked off the beach at 4am, dirty dancing at the Daquiri Deck, spikeball vs Truck/Scandal) as well as
people I don&rsquo;t get to see that often (again at the Deck, and at the fields, and the beach, and random places in between).</p>

<p>Hope to do it all again next year.</p>

    <p>Had a great time at Beach Nationals with Weekend with Bernie. Everyone on the team were Youngbloods players, except me and Max. The team was
a lot of fun, both on and off the field. We came in seeded 15th but finished 10th. Personally, I played really well on Saturday. I only had
two turns, both against Amp in our crossover game. One was a drop, one was a huck that went just a bit too far. Other than that, my throws
were on point and my D was very solid. The game against Amp was actually my best game, with lots of nice breaks and good cutting.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I played really bad. I threw a bunch of turns, was not focused on D, and was all around pretty meh. Maybe staying up all night
raging <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> make you better at sports?</p>

    <p>3 days of ultimate with Metro North. Played 7 games total. Didn&rsquo;t play that great overall, but improved throughout the weekend. Best game was the last game against Wildcard.</p>

<p>In general, my main places to improve are fitness (as always), throwing, and switching my mindset from D to O. My biggest issue was too many bad throwing decisions after getting a turn. I play much better when I look for breaks and move the disc quickly, not try to huck it. I don&rsquo;t think I completed any hucks at all this weekend.</p>

<p>Btw, we finished 7th at nationals and qualified for the Pro Flight for next year.</p>

<p><em>I believe that love will find a way.</em></p>

    <p>Nationals this year was good and bad in a lot of ways. We played very well during most of our games, we won more games than any previous year, and we beat
one of our arch-rivals (Polar Bears) in a strong win on Friday. But we also finished worse than last year and lost our last game on Sat to a team we should
have beaten.</p>

<p>On Thursday, we started off strong with a close game against CLX. We had the opportunity to win it, but some late-game turnovers (two by me) gave them the
lead back and we lost 13-11. We rebounded and fought hard to win 11-9 against 7 Figures, then crushed Cosa 15-4 in the last game. On Friday, we lost our
pre-quarters game 15-10 to Slow White, beat D'oh 15-11, then took down Polar Bears 14-8. The Polar Bears win was extra satisfying because we clearly saw
our defense working well. For the first half of the game, we shut down their deep cuts with strong physical defense. In the second half, they started to
bring all their cuts under and across, and we took advantage by playing tighter and getting a bunch of Ds. I think we scored 3 or 4 breaks in a row in the
second half. For our last game Sat morning, we were up a few breaks on Santa Maria but they came back to win on universe (13-12).</p>

<p>My takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue to improve throwing and reduce turnovers. I only had turnovers in the games that we lost (2 each game vs CLX, Slow, Santa Maria).</li>
<li>Be more disciplined on D. I still give up the deep sometimes.</li>
<li>Still not great under pressure. Half of my throwaways were rushed throws at crucial moments in the game when we should be extra careful. When the
pressure is on, respond by being even more patient and conservative.</li>

    <p>Reproduced here in it&rsquo;s full glory.</p>

<blockquote><p>AMP&rsquo;s made progress again! Meeting physical ambitions, mastering planks and maneuvering past all Mid-Atlantic predicted adversaries, making postseason annual migration pattern.</p>

<p>Aggressive marking positions and magnificent plays are making people afraid. Meanwhile, Princess and Miggs [pseudonymns] are match-up problems, and Michael Panna a major pickup, adding more potent attacks. Mustached Purifico assaults molded plastic, Andrea&rsquo;s most passionate and Melissa&rsquo;s perfect at motivating players. Adept Melanie preserves AMP&rsquo;s major possessions, and Maddie, Pelleg and Matt Paparone are massive performers. Alex&rsquo;s mammoth pulls and magical point-blocks always mystify people.</p>

<p>Allowing momentary pause, all members prepare and meticulously plan a merciless push. After mental preparation and much practicing, another mighty pool awaits mixed Philadelphians. AMP&rsquo;s mission plan: attack, make plays, achieve maximum pleasure and modern prominence.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Nationals this year was very fun and also somewhat disappointing. We did not achieve our goal of making semis and most likely failed to qualify for Worlds. However, we played well most of the time and had some great games (especially vs. Slow White in pre-quarters). Personally I&rsquo;m happy with how I played. I didn&rsquo;t get much PT on Thursday, but played a lot on Friday. I got equal time on the O line and the D line, which is a first for me since college. I only had 2 turns (one less than last Nationals), though they were both in our most important game (quarters vs. Wildcard). I also didn&rsquo;t have any solid Ds (one got caught by a different player, another was really a drop by the O guy and not my D). Despite being -2 on my scale, I think my game was solid and I did the right thing most of the time.</p>

<p>The main things I need to work on are still throws, speed, and anticipation on D.</p>
